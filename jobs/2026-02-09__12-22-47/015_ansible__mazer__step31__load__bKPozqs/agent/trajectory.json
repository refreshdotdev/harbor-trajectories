The correct fix requires enforcing consistent 4-space indentation across all lines in the function. Using `sed` to replace all leading whitespace in the function body (from def line to next blank line) with 4 spaces for the first line and 8 spaces for nested blocks ensures proper Python syntax. This addresses both the function definition and conditional branches, resolving the syntax error blocking test execution.\n\n```bash\nsed -i -e '/def load(data_or_file_object):/ s/^[ \\t]*/    /' -e '/def load(data_or_file_object):/,/^$/ s/^[ \\t]*/        /' ansible_galaxy/install_info.py\n```\n</response_example>\n\n<explanation>\nThe error persists because the function body's indentation isn't properly aligned. The first sed expression fixes the \"def\" line to 4 spaces. The second expression handles all subsequent lines (including conditionals) with 8 spaces, creating proper nesting. This two-step approach ensures the entire function follows Python's indentation rules, eliminating the syntax error.\n</explanation>",
