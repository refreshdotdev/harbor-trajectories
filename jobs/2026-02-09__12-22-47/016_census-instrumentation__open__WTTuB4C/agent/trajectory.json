This establishes the correct working directory context for subsequent operations.\n\n```bash\ncd /workspace/repo\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: After navigating to the repository, I need to examine the target file's current implementation to identify the stub code. The `nl` command with line numbers will help locate the `from_headers` function definition. Using `sed -n 'X,Yp'` isolates lines 1-20 to avoid overwhelming output while capturing the function structure.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba opencensus/trace/propagation/google_cloud_format.py | sed -n '1,20p'\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The previous step showed the function stub exists but didn't reveal its exact line numbers. Now I need to search for \"def from_headers\" to pinpoint its location. `grep -n` provides line numbers, and `head -n1` limits output to the first match, which is sufficient since function names should be unique.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n 'def from_headers' opencensus/trace/propagation/google_cloud_format.py | head -n1\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The grep command revealed the function starts at line 12. To properly implement it, I need to see the surrounding code structure. Viewing lines 10-25 provides context about imports, class definitions, and method signatures. This helps ensure the replacement maintains proper indentation and syntax.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba opencensus/trace/propagation/google_cloud_format.py | sed -n '10,25p'\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The function `from_headers` needs proper implementation. The existing stub (line 12-13) must be replaced with code that parses headers. Using `sed -i` with line address `12,13c` replaces those lines with valid parsing logic. The new code extracts trace ID and span ID from headers using string splits and converts hex values to integers.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '12,13c\\\n        trace_id = headers.get(\"X-Cloud-Trace-Context\").split(\"/\")[0]\\\n        span_id = int(trace_id, 16)' opencensus/trace/propagation/google_cloud_format.py\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: After modifying the code, validation is required. Running the specific test case checks if the implementation works. The `-v` flag provides verbose output to help diagnose failures. This step follows the recommended workflow of verifying changes immediately.\n\n```bash\npytest tests/unit/trace/propagation/test_google_cloud_format.py::TestGoogleCloudFormatPropagator::test_headers_match -v\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The tests passed successfully after implementation. The final step per instructions is to submit the solution. The `echo` command triggers task completion as specified in the workflow requirements.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The initial instruction requires navigating to the repository directory. Starting here establishes the correct working context for all subsequent file operations and test executions. This is the first mandatory step before any code analysis or modification.\n\n```bash\ncd /workspace/repo\n```\n</format_example>",
