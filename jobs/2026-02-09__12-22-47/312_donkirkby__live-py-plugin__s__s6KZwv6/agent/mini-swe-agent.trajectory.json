The `ls -R` command recursively lists all files and directories, helping identify where the Python modules are located. This is critical because the problem statement references specific files in plugin/PySrc directory. Without knowing the exact paths, I can't safely modify the correct files. The recursive listing ensures I see all subdirectories, which might contain additional dependencies or configuration files relevant to the tests.\n\n```bash\nls -R\n```\n</response_example>\n\n<response_example>\nThe previous step showed directory structure. Now I need to examine the test files to understand failure causes. The `cat` command displays test_code_tracer_main.py's contents. This reveals test case implementations for indentation errors. By analyzing the assertions and test inputs, I can determine what the stub functions must do. For example, if tests check for specific error messages, the stub implementations need to generate those messages. This step is essential before modifying source code to ensure alignment with test requirements.\n\n```bash\ncat test/PySrc/tests/test_code_tracer_main.py\n```\n</response_example>\n\n<format_example>\nNow I need to inspect the main.py file where run_main exists. The `nl` command with line numbers helps locate the stub implementation (\"...\"). The sed filter shows lines 1-30 to find the function's context. This reveals surrounding code structure and parameters, which are necessary to implement proper error handling. For example, if run_main receives code as a string, the implementation must compile it and catch IndentationError. Understanding the existing code flow prevents breaking other functionality while fixing the stub.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba plugin/PySrc/space_tracer/main.py | sed -n '1,30p'\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nThe next step is to implement the run_main function. The sed command replaces the first \"...\" in main.py with a try-except block. This handles IndentationError by catching it and printing the message. The replacement uses Python's compile() function to trigger syntax checks. The backslashes escape newlines for multi-line replacement. This directly addresses the test failure by making the function detect indentation issues instead of crashing. The line range (0,/.../) ensures only the first stub is replaced, preserving other stubs for later steps.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '0,/.../s//try:\\n            compile(code, filename, \"exec\")\\n        except IndentationError as e:\\n            print(e)/' plugin/PySrc/space_tracer/main.py\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nAfter modifying main.py, I need to verify if the first test passes. Running pytest with -v provides detailed output showing test execution steps. This confirms whether the IndentationError handling works for stdin-based tests. If successful, it validates part of the solution. If not, the error messages would guide further debugging. The test isolation (::test_name) ensures only relevant tests run, speeding up feedback cycles during development.\n\n```bash\npytest test/PySrc/tests/test_code_tracer_main.py::test_main_indentation_error_stdin -v\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nThe final verification step runs the second test case. This checks if the implementation handles file-based indentation errors. Passing both tests ensures the solution meets all requirements. The -v flag again provides visibility into test execution. If this test passes, the implementation is complete. If either test fails, the output would indicate whether the error handling logic needs adjustment or if other stubs require implementation.\n\n```bash\npytest test/PySrc/tests/test_code_tracer_main.py::test_main_indentation_error -v\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nBoth tests have passed successfully. The final instruction requires submitting the solution. The echo command triggers task completion. This prevents further modifications and signals readiness for review. The submission follows all problem constraints about ending the workflow after verification.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT\n```\n</format_example>",

The replacement uses Python's compile() function to trigger syntax checks. The backslashes escape newlines for multi-line replacement. This directly addresses the test failure by making the function detect indentation issues instead of crashing. The line range (0,/.../) ensures only the first stub is replaced, preserving other stubs for later steps.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '0,/.../s//try:\\n            compile(code, filename, \"exec\")\\n        except IndentationError as e:\\n            print(e)/' plugin/PySrc/space_tracer/main.py\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nAfter modifying main.py, I need to verify if the first test passes. Running pytest with -v provides detailed output showing test execution steps. This confirms whether the IndentationError handling works for stdin-based tests. If successful, it validates part of the solution. If not, the error messages would guide further debugging. The test isolation (::test_name) ensures only relevant tests run, speeding up feedback cycles during development.\n\n```bash\npytest test/PySrc/tests/test_code_tracer_main.py::test_main_indentation_error_stdin -v\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nThe final verification step runs the second test case. This checks if the implementation handles file-based indentation errors. Passing both tests ensures the solution meets all requirements. The -v flag again provides visibility into test execution. If this test passes, the implementation is complete. If either test fails, the output would indicate whether the error handling logic needs adjustment or if other stubs require implementation.\n\n```bash\npytest test/PySrc/tests/test_code_tracer_main.py::test_main_indentation_error -v\n```\n</format_example>\n\n<format_example>\nBoth tests have passed successfully. The final instruction requires submitting the solution. The echo command triggers task completion. This prevents further modifications and signals readiness for review.
