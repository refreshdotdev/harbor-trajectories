You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# MLOps Legacy Archive & Inventory Task

You are taking over a cleanup task from a previous engineer who left abruptly. We have a set of experiment runs in `/home/user/experiments/` that need to be archived and cataloged. The directory structure is standard (`run_YYYY-MM-DD/...`), containing model checkpoints (`.ckpt`), logs, and metrics.

However, the previous engineer mentioned that the data is "messy" due to mixed environments (Windows/Linux) and different encoding standards used by the research team. You must write a robust script to standardize this.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Checkpoint Archival with Content-Based Renaming
Move all **valid** model checkpoints into `/home/user/experiments/ckpt_archive/`. 

*   **Validity Check:** Due to a disk flush error last week, some `.ckpt` files are corrupted (truncated). A valid checkpoint is defined strictly as a file ending in `.ckpt` with a file size **greater than 1KB (1024 bytes)**. Files smaller than or equal to this size are effectively garbage; **do not move them**, and leave them where they are (they will be deleted by a separate cronjob later, so ignore them).
*   **Renaming Logic:** To organize the archive, we rename files based on their training performance. You must parse the `metrics.json` file located in the same directory as the checkpoint. 
    *   Target filename format: `loss_{L}__{original_name}`
    *   Where `{L}` is the value associated with the `"loss"` key in `metrics.json`.
    *   If `metrics.json` is missing, unreadable, or does not contain a valid `"loss"` float, use `loss_unknown` as the prefix.
    *   *Note:* The `metrics.json` files were generated by different tools. Some are standard UTF-8, some have a Windows Byte Order Mark (UTF-8-SIG), and some are legacy Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1). Your script must handle these encoding variations automatically.

### 2. The Legacy Inventory File
Generate a manifest of all files remaining in the experiment tree (including the newly archived checkpoints) at `/home/user/experiments/artifact_inventory.csv`.

*   **Format:** Despite the `.csv` extension, our downstream Windows processing pipeline requires **semicolon (`;`) delimiters**.
*   **Columns:** `filepath;size_bytes;sha256`
*   **Encoding:** The file **MUST** be encoded in **UTF-16LE** (Little Endian) and must start with the appropriate Byte Order Mark (BOM). 
*   **Line Endings:** Use Windows-style **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line endings.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the rows by `filepath` using a **case-insensitive** lexicographical sort.
*   **Exclusions:** Do not include the `artifact_inventory.csv` file itself or the `cleanup.log` file in this list.

### 3. Summary Log with Integrity Check
Write a summary to `/home/user/experiments/cleanup.log`.

*   **Layout:**
    ```
    VALID_CKPTS_MOVED: <N>
    GLOBAL_AVG_LOSS: <F>
    INVENTORY_MD5: <H>
    ```
*   **Definitions:**
    *   `<N>`: Total count of valid checkpoints moved.
    *   `<F>`: The arithmetic mean of the `loss` values from **ALL** readable `metrics.json` files found in `run_*` directories (even those that didn't yield a valid checkpoint), formatted to 4 decimal places.
    *   `<H>`: The **MD5 checksum** of the final `artifact_inventory.csv` file you generated in step 2. (This ensures we can verify the inventory hasn't been tampered with).
*   **Permissions:** This log file contains sensitive aggregate metrics, so set its permissions to **read-only for the owner (0400)**.

## Summary of Constraints
*   **Environment:** You are working in a standard Linux container, but the file system is populated with files from mixed OS sources.
*   **Dependencies:** Use standard Python 3 libraries. `pip` is available if absolutely necessary, but standard lib is preferred for stability.
*   **Safety:** Do not delete any files. Do not move invalid checkpoints.
