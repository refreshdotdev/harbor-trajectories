  "analysis": "The terminal is currently waiting for input, indicated by the `>` prompt. This usually occurs when a heredoc (the `<< 'EOF'` pattern) is not properly terminated. In the previous command sequence, the `cat > /home/user/experiments/manage_experiments.py << 'EOF' ... EOF` command was intended to create the Python script. The truncated output showing `...` and ending with `>` suggests that the shell is still waiting for the end of the heredoc, meaning the `EOF` delimiter was likely not correctly processed or the command was not fully sent.",
  "plan": "To recover from this state, I will first attempt to exit the heredoc input mode by sending the `EOF` delimiter. If this successfully creates the script file, I will then make it executable and execute it as planned. If the `EOF` itself doesn't resolve the issue or if the script file is not created as expected, I will need to cancel the current stuck command and then recreate the script using a more robust method, such as `printf` with a heredoc or by creating the file in smaller, more manageable chunks if the initial approach fails.",
