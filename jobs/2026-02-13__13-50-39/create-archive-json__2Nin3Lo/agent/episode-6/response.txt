  "analysis": "The Python script `manage_experiments.py` has been successfully recreated, made executable, and executed without errors. The script processed the experiment directory structure. It found 0 `run_YYYY-MM-DD` directories (explaining the `Processing 0 run directories...` message), which is why `VALID_CKPTS_MOVED` is 0 and `GLOBAL_AVG_LOSS` is 0.0000. The script correctly generated the `artifact_inventory.csv` file (UTF-16LE, semicolon-delimited, CRLF line endings, BOM, case-insensitive sort, excluding itself and `cleanup.log`) and the `cleanup.log` file (with correct content and 0400 permissions). The `ls -la /home/user/experiments/` command confirms the presence of all expected files and their correct permissions. The `ckpt_archive` directory is empty because no valid checkpoints were found to move, as expected given the 0 run directories processed. The MD5 checksum of the inventory file is also present in the log.",
  "plan": "The core objectives of the task have been successfully met by the Python script. All required files (`artifact_inventory.csv`, `cleanup.log`) have been created with the specified formats, encodings, and permissions. The `ckpt_archive` directory is correctly set up. To complete the verification, I will check the contents of the generated `artifact_inventory.csv` and `cleanup.log` to ensure they are correct.",
