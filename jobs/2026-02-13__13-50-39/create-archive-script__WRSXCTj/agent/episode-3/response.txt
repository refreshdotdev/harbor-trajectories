  "analysis": "The script encountered an error because the `configs/config_backup.conf` file does not contain a valid 8-digit date in its name, causing the arithmetic comparison to fail. I need to handle files that do not match the expected naming convention. I will modify the approach to only process files that strictly match the `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` pattern before attempting to extract the date. This will prevent errors on files with incorrect naming.",
  "plan": "I will re-generate the list of files, but this time I will filter the list to include only files that match the exact pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` using a more precise `ls` command with a wildcard. Then, I will extract the date portion and compare it with the reference date. Only files with valid dates that are not strictly later than the reference date will be considered valid.",
