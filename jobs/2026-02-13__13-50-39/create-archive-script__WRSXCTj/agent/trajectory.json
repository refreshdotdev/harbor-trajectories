      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a configuration-manager who has been handed a small archive of historical application configuration files. All files are already present on the system under `/home/user/configs/`.\n\nHowever, the archive is messy. It contains backup files, future drafts, and files with varying syntax rules.\n\nYour job is to produce a set of summary artefacts using standard UNIX text-processing utilities (awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, etc.). Do not use scripting languages such as Python, Perl, or jq.\n\n### 1. File Selection Rules\n\n*   **Naming Convention**: You must ONLY process files matching the pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` (where YYYYMMDD is an 8-digit date).\n*   **Reference Date**: A file `/home/user/reference_date.txt` contains a single line with a reference date (YYYYMMDD).\n*   **Time Travel Rule**: Any configuration file whose date is **strictly later** than the reference date is considered a \"future draft\" and must be **completely ignored**. It should not contribute to any counts, keys, or outputs.\n\n### 2. Syntax & Parsing Rules\n\nEach valid file follows the pattern `key = value`, but with specific quoting rules:\n\n*   **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` (ignoring whitespace) are comments.\n*   **Keys**: Case-insensitive (treat as lower-case). Strip surrounding whitespace.\n*   **Values (Quoted)**: If the first non-whitespace character after the `=` is a double-quote (`\"`), the value is the content *between* that quote and the next double-quote. \n    *   Content inside quotes is preserved exactly (including whitespace and `#` characters).\n    *   Any text after the closing quote is ignored.\n*   **Values (Unquoted)**: If the value is not quoted:\n    *   It ends at the first `#` character or the end of the line.\n    *   Leading and trailing whitespace must be stripped.\n*   **Blank Lines**: Ignored.\n\n### 3. Required Outputs\n\nWhen finished, the following objects must exist:\n\n1.  **Directory**: `/home/user/output/` and `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n\n2.  **File**: `/home/user/output/config_line_counts.tsv`\n    *   Tab-separated: `filename<TAB>count`\n    *   Count of \"active\" lines (non-blank, non-comment) for each **valid** file.\n    *   Sorted chronologically (oldest valid file first).\n\n3.  **File**: `/home/user/output/all_keys.txt`\n    *   Union of all keys found in all **valid** files.\n    *   Lower-case, sorted alphabetically, unique.\n\n4.  **Directory**: `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n    *   Contains one sanitised copy of every **valid** configuration file.\n    *   Filename: Same as original.\n    *   Format: `key=value` (no spaces around `=`).\n    *   **Crucial**: If the original value was quoted, the sanitised file must contain the value **unquoted** (the content inside the quotes). Examples:\n        *   `key = \" foo # bar \"`  -> `key= foo # bar `\n        *   `key = plain # comment` -> `key=plain`\n\n5.  **File**: `/home/user/output/new_keys.log`\n    *   Keys present in the **newest valid** file but absent from the **oldest valid** file.\n    *   Format: One key per line, sorted.\n\n6.  **File**: `/home/user/output/merged_config.csv`\n    *   A CSV summary of the final active configuration.\n    *   Header: `Key,Value,Source`\n    *   Rows: For every unique key found across all valid files, list the **Key**, its **Value** from the *latest valid file* that defined it, and the **Source** filename where that value was found.\n    *   Sorted alphabetically by Key.\n    *   Assume values do not contain commas.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   Work only in the terminal.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   Do not use Python, Perl, Ruby, JS, or jq.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e21e99f7-1d6c-42af-b2f8-aab950034327:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Then, I will loop through each file in the sorted list of valid configuration files. For each file, I will: \n1. Use the `parse_config_file` function to generate a cleaned version and save it to `clean_configs/`. \n2. Count the number of active lines in the cleaned output for the `config_line_counts.tsv` file. \n3. Extract and store key-value pairs for later use in `merged_config.csv`. \n4.
