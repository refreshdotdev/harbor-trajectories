            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a configuration-manager who has been handed a small archive of historical application configuration files. All files are already present on the system under `/home/user/configs/`.\n\nHowever, the archive is messy. It contains backup files, future drafts, and files with varying syntax rules.\n\nYour job is to produce a set of summary artefacts using standard UNIX text-processing utilities (awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, etc.). Do not use scripting languages such as Python, Perl, or jq.\n\n### 1. File Selection Rules\n\n*   **Naming Convention**: You must ONLY process files matching the pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` (where YYYYMMDD is an 8-digit date).\n*   **Reference Date**: A file `/home/user/reference_date.txt` contains a single line with a reference date (YYYYMMDD).\n*   **Time Travel Rule**: Any configuration file whose date is **strictly later** than the reference date is considered a \"future draft\" and must be **completely ignored**. It should not contribute to any counts, keys, or outputs.\n\n### 2. Syntax & Parsing Rules\n\nEach valid file follows the pattern `key = value`, but with specific quoting rules:\n\n*   **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` (ignoring whitespace) are comments.\n*   **Keys**: Case-insensitive (treat as lower-case). Strip surrounding whitespace.\n*   **Values (Quoted)**: If the first non-whitespace character after the `=` is a double-quote (`\"`), the value is the content *between* that quote and the next double-quote. \n    *   Content inside quotes is preserved exactly (including whitespace and `#` characters).\n    *   Any text after the closing quote is ignored.\n*   **Values (Unquoted)**: If the value is not quoted:\n    *   It ends at the first `#` character or the end of the line.\n    *   Leading and trailing whitespace must be stripped.\n*   **Blank Lines**: Ignored.\n\n### 3. Required Outputs\n\nWhen finished, the following objects must exist:\n\n1.  **Directory**: `/home/user/output/` and `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n\n2.  **File**: `/home/user/output/config_line_counts.tsv`\n    *   Tab-separated: `filename<TAB>count`\n    *   Count of \"active\" lines (non-blank, non-comment) for each **valid** file.\n    *   Sorted chronologically (oldest valid file first).\n\n3.  **File**: `/home/user/output/all_keys.txt`\n    *   Union of all keys found in all **valid** files.\n    *   Lower-case, sorted alphabetically, unique.\n\n4.  **Directory**: `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n    *   Contains one sanitised copy of every **valid** configuration file.\n    *   Filename: Same as original.\n    *   Format: `key=value` (no spaces around `=`).\n    *   **Crucial**: If the original value was quoted, the sanitised file must contain the value **unquoted** (the content inside the quotes). Examples:\n        *   `key = \" foo # bar \"`  -> `key= foo # bar `\n        *   `key = plain # comment` -> `key=plain`\n\n5.  **File**: `/home/user/output/new_keys.log`\n    *   Keys present in the **newest valid** file but absent from the **oldest valid** file.\n    *   Format: One key per line, sorted.\n\n6.  **File**: `/home/user/output/merged_config.csv`\n    *   A CSV summary of the final active configuration.\n    *   Header: `Key,Value,Source`\n    *   Rows: For every unique key found across all valid files, list the **Key**, its **Value** from the *latest valid file* that defined it, and the **Source** filename where that value was found.\n    *   Sorted alphabetically by Key.\n    *   Assume values do not contain commas.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   Work only in the terminal.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   Do not use Python, Perl, Ruby, JS, or jq.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@95c1b8b6-f4d6-4d41-9b39-415e0e3668a1:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a configuration-manager who has been handed a small archive of historical application configuration files. All files are already present on the system under `/home/user/configs/`.\n\nHowever, the archive is messy. It contains backup files, future drafts, and files with varying syntax rules.\n\nYour job is to produce a set of summary artefacts using standard UNIX text-processing utilities (awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, etc.). Do not use scripting languages such as Python, Perl, or jq.\n\n### 1. File Selection Rules\n\n*   **Naming Convention**: You must ONLY process files matching the pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` (where YYYYMMDD is an 8-digit date).\n*   **Reference Date**: A file `/home/user/reference_date.txt` contains a single line with a reference date (YYYYMMDD).\n*   **Time Travel Rule**: Any configuration file whose date is **strictly later** than the reference date is considered a \"future draft\" and must be **completely ignored**. It should not contribute to any counts, keys, or outputs.\n\n### 2. Syntax & Parsing Rules\n\nEach valid file follows the pattern `key = value`, but with specific quoting rules:\n\n*   **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` (ignoring whitespace) are comments.\n*   **Keys**: Case-insensitive (treat as lower-case). Strip surrounding whitespace.\n*   **Values (Quoted)**: If the first non-whitespace character after the `=` is a double-quote (`\"`), the value is the content *between* that quote and the next double-quote. \n    *   Content inside quotes is preserved exactly (including whitespace and `#` characters).\n    *   Any text after the closing quote is ignored.\n*   **Values (Unquoted)**: If the value is not quoted:\n    *   It ends at the first `#` character or the end of the line.\n    *   Leading and trailing whitespace must be stripped.\n*   **Blank Lines**: Ignored.\n\n### 3. Required Outputs\n\nWhen finished, the following objects must exist:\n\n1.  **Directory**: `/home/user/output/` and `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n\n2.  **File**: `/home/user/output/config_line_counts.tsv`\n    *   Tab-separated: `filename<TAB>count`\n    *   Count of \"active\" lines (non-blank, non-comment) for each **valid** file.\n    *   Sorted chronologically (oldest valid file first).\n\n3.  **File**: `/home/user/output/all_keys.txt`\n    *   Union of all keys found in all **valid** files.\n    *   Lower-case, sorted alphabetically, unique.\n\n4.  **Directory**: `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n    *   Contains one sanitised copy of every **valid** configuration file.\n    *   Filename: Same as original.\n    *   Format: `key=value` (no spaces around `=`).\n    *   **Crucial**: If the original value was quoted, the sanitised file must contain the value **unquoted** (the content inside the quotes). Examples:\n        *   `key = \" foo # bar \"`  -> `key= foo # bar `\n        *   `key = plain # comment` -> `key=plain`\n\n5.  **File**: `/home/user/output/new_keys.log`\n    *   Keys present in the **newest valid** file but absent from the **oldest valid** file.\n    *   Format: One key per line, sorted.\n\n6.  **File**: `/home/user/output/merged_config.csv`\n    *   A CSV summary of the final active configuration.\n    *   Header: `Key,Value,Source`\n    *   Rows: For every unique key found across all valid files, list the **Key**, its **Value** from the *latest valid file* that defined it, and the **Source** filename where that value was found.\n    *   Sorted alphabetically by Key.\n    *   Assume values do not contain commas.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   Work only in the terminal.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   Do not use Python, Perl, Ruby, JS, or jq.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@95c1b8b6-f4d6-4d41-9b39-415e0e3668a1:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a configuration-manager who has been handed a small archive of historical application configuration files. All files are already present on the system under `/home/user/configs/`.\n\nHowever, the archive is messy. It contains backup files, future drafts, and files with varying syntax rules.\n\nYour job is to produce a set of summary artefacts using standard UNIX text-processing utilities (awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, etc.). Do not use scripting languages such as Python, Perl, or jq.\n\n### 1. File Selection Rules\n\n*   **Naming Convention**: You must ONLY process files matching the pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` (where YYYYMMDD is an 8-digit date).\n*   **Reference Date**: A file `/home/user/reference_date.txt` contains a single line with a reference date (YYYYMMDD).\n*   **Time Travel Rule**: Any configuration file whose date is **strictly later** than the reference date is considered a \"future draft\" and must be **completely ignored**. It should not contribute to any counts, keys, or outputs.\n\n### 2. Syntax & Parsing Rules\n\nEach valid file follows the pattern `key = value`, but with specific quoting rules:\n\n*   **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` (ignoring whitespace) are comments.\n*   **Keys**: Case-insensitive (treat as lower-case). Strip surrounding whitespace.\n*   **Values (Quoted)**: If the first non-whitespace character after the `=` is a double-quote (`\"`), the value is the content *between* that quote and the next double-quote. \n    *   Content inside quotes is preserved exactly (including whitespace and `#` characters).\n    *   Any text after the closing quote is ignored.\n*   **Values (Unquoted)**: If the value is not quoted:\n    *   It ends at the first `#` character or the end of the line.\n    *   Leading and trailing whitespace must be stripped.\n*   **Blank Lines**: Ignored.\n\n### 3. Required Outputs\n\nWhen finished, the following objects must exist:\n\n1.  **Directory**: `/home/user/output/` and `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n\n2.  **File**: `/home/user/output/config_line_counts.tsv`\n    *   Tab-separated: `filename<TAB>count`\n    *   Count of \"active\" lines (non-blank, non-comment) for each **valid** file.\n    *   Sorted chronologically (oldest valid file first).\n\n3.  **File**: `/home/user/output/all_keys.txt`\n    *   Union of all keys found in all **valid** files.\n    *   Lower-case, sorted alphabetically, unique.\n\n4.  **Directory**: `/home/user/clean_configs/`\n    *   Contains one sanitised copy of every **valid** configuration file.\n    *   Filename: Same as original.\n    *   Format: `key=value` (no spaces around `=`).\n    *   **Crucial**: If the original value was quoted, the sanitised file must contain the value **unquoted** (the content inside the quotes). Examples:\n        *   `key = \" foo # bar \"`  -> `key= foo # bar `\n        *   `key = plain # comment` -> `key=plain`\n\n5.  **File**: `/home/user/output/new_keys.log`\n    *   Keys present in the **newest valid** file but absent from the **oldest valid** file.\n    *   Format: One key per line, sorted.\n\n6.  **File**: `/home/user/output/merged_config.csv`\n    *   A CSV summary of the final active configuration.\n    *   Header: `Key,Value,Source`\n    *   Rows: For every unique key found across all valid files, list the **Key**, its **Value** from the *latest valid file* that defined it, and the **Source** filename where that value was found.\n    *   Sorted alphabetically by Key.\n    *   Assume values do not contain commas.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   Work only in the terminal.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   Do not use Python, Perl, Ruby, JS, or jq.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@95c1b8b6-f4d6-4d41-9b39-415e0e3668a1:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The next step is to process each of these files to extract information and generate the required output artefacts. I'll start by creating the line counts file and then process the files one by one.

Create `output/config_line_counts.tsv` with the header. 2. Define a general AWK script for parsing configuration files. This script will need to handle: comments, blank lines, case-insensitive keys (convert to lowercase), stripping whitespace, and correctly parsing quoted and unquoted values. 3. For each valid file, use the AWK script to count active lines and store this count. The counts will be written to `config_line_counts.tsv` later. 4. Simultaneously, extract all keys for `all_keys.txt`. 5.
