  "analysis": "The AWK script encountered issues when processing the configuration files. The warnings `Warning: issues processing config_YYYYMMDD.conf` indicate that the script might not be executable or might have errors preventing it from running correctly on the files. Since I made the script executable with `chmod +x`, it's likely there's an issue with the AWK script's syntax or logic, or the way it's being called, or the AWK interpreter itself. I need to debug this.",
  "plan": "1. First, let's test the AWK script on a sample configuration file or a simple test case to see if it runs. I'll create a small test file. 2. If it fails to run due to a permission error despite `chmod +x`, I'll try invoking AWK directly, e.g., `awk -f process_config.awk`. 3. If the script itself has errors, I'll need to correct them. For now, I'll assume it's an execution issue and try the direct `awk -f` call. I'll also check the content of the generated `.processed` files to see if any output was written.",
