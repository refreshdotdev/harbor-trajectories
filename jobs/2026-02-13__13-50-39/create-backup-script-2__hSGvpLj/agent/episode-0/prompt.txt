You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a Linux systems engineer who has been asked to create a generic “lab-hardening” automation in your own home directory.
Three configuration files and a **rules file** have already been placed in `/home/user/hardening_test/` for you to practise on.
Your goal is to write one self-contained POSIX-sh compatible script named

    /home/user/hardening_test/apply_hardening.sh

that performs all of the actions listed below.

### Automation requirements

1.  **Rule-based Processing**
    *   The script must read the hardening rules from `/home/user/hardening_test/rules.txt`.
    *   Each line in this file follows the format: `filename|search_pattern|enforced_line`
        *   `filename`: The target file in the current directory.
        *   `search_pattern`: A grep-compatible Extended Regex (ERE) used to find existing configuration keys.
        *   `enforced_line`: The exact string that must be present in the file.

2.  **Safety Backup**
    *   Before processing a file, check if a backup named `<filename>.bak` exists.
    *   If `<filename>.bak` does **not** exist, create it as a copy of the current file.
    *   If `<filename>.bak` **already** exists, preserve it (do not overwrite it). This ensures we always keep the pristine original state.

3.  **Tri-state Logic**
    *   For each file defined in `rules.txt`, apply the following logic in order:
        1.  **SKIPPED**: If the file already contains the `enforced_line` exactly (byte-for-byte line match), do nothing to the content.
        2.  **REPAIRED**: If the file does *not* contain the exact line, but *does* contain a line matching the `search_pattern`, replace that matching line with the `enforced_line` in-place.
        3.  **APPENDED**: If the `search_pattern` is not found at all, append the `enforced_line` to the end of the file.

4.  **Strict Permissions**
    *   After processing (regardless of whether the file was changed), enforce the following permissions:
        *   `sshd_config`: Read/Write for owner only (0600).
        *   All other files: Read/Write for owner, Read for group/others (0644).

5.  **Structured & Sorted Logging**
    *   The script must create/overwrite a log file:
        `/home/user/hardening_test/hardening.log`
    *   Format per line: `<FILENAME>:<ACTION>`
        *   `<ACTION>` is one of: `SKIPPED`, `REPAIRED`, `APPENDED`.
    *   **Constraint**: The final lines in `hardening.log` must be **sorted alphabetically** by filename.

    Example of a sorted log:
    ```
    login.defs:SKIPPED
    sshd_config:REPAIRED
    sysctl.conf:APPENDED
    ```

6.  **User feedback**
    *   When the script finishes, it must print the single line

            Hardening completed

        to STDOUT (nothing else).

### Additional constraints

*   The script must be executable (chmod +x).
*   Use only shell built-ins and common GNU/Linux user-land tools (grep, sed, sort, chmod, etc.).
*   Do not edit files outside `/home/user/hardening_test/`.
*   Ensure that the final state exactly meets the specifications so that an automated grader can validate:
    *   presence of `*.bak` backups (byte-for-byte copy of the originals),
    *   target files contain the enforced lines (no duplicates created if already present),
    *   correct permissions on target files,
    *   a correctly formatted and sorted `hardening.log`.
