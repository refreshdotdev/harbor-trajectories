You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a network engineer called in to troubleshoot a connectivity problem on a router. A configuration directory structure exists, but the environment is dynamic, and the files have formatting inconsistencies.

### Environment

*   The configuration root directory is defined by the environment variable `NET_CONF_DIR`. You **must** use this variable. If it is not set, default to `/home/user/network_ops`.
*   Inside this directory, there are two subdirectories:
    *   `baseline/` (contains the known-good `router.conf`)
    *   `current/` (contains the broken `router.conf`)

### Complications

1.  **Line Endings**: The `current/router.conf` file was uploaded from a Windows machine and contains DOS line endings (CRLF). The `baseline/router.conf` uses Unix line endings (LF). Your final fixed file must use Unix line endings.
2.  **Backup**: Before modifying anything, you must create a compressed backup of the original broken file.
3.  **Metrics**: You must calculate and log specific file size metrics.

### Objective

Perform the following sequence of operations. If any step fails, you should log a failure (though the grader expects success).

1.  **Backup**: Create a gzip-compressed backup of the *original* `current/router.conf` (including its DOS line endings) at `backups/router.conf.orig.gz` (inside the configuration root).
2.  **Normalize**: Convert `current/router.conf` to use Unix line endings (LF) in-place.
3.  **Patch Creation**: Produce a unified-diff patch that converts the now-normalized `current/router.conf` into `baseline/router.conf`. Save it to `patches/router_fix.patch`.
4.  **Metrics**: Create a JSON file `logs/metrics.json` containing the size of the *original* (pre-normalization) file and the size of the generated patch file.
5.  **Apply**: Apply the patch to `current/router.conf`.
6.  **Verify**: Ensure the file is now byte-for-byte identical to baseline.

### File & Directory Rules

*   **Root Directory**: Use `$NET_CONF_DIR`.
*   **Patch Format**: Standard GNU unified-diff.
    *   Header:
        ```
        --- current/router.conf
        +++ baseline/router.conf
        ```
    *   Required Hunks (LF format) - ensure these changes are present:
        ```
        - ip address 10.0.0.2/24
        + ip address 10.0.0.1/24
        - shutdown
        + no shutdown
        + network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
        ```
*   **Metrics File**: `logs/metrics.json` must be valid JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "original_size_bytes": 1234,
      "patch_size_bytes": 567
    }
    ```

*   **Log File**: `logs/patch_application.log` must contain exactly **five** lines in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ - ACTION - RESULT`. The actions must appear in this order:
    1.  `BACKED_UP`
    2.  `NORMALIZED_LF`
    3.  `CREATED_PATCH`
    4.  `APPLIED_PATCH`
    5.  `VERIFIED_CONFIG`

    All results should be `OK`.

### Final Check

The grader will verify:
1.  `backups/router.conf.orig.gz` exists and is a valid gzip file.
2.  `current/router.conf` is byte-identical to `baseline/router.conf` (LF endings).
3.  `logs/metrics.json` exists and contains valid integers.
4.  `logs/patch_application.log` has 5 correct lines.
5.  The patch file exists and is valid.
