  "analysis": "The environment has been successfully reset. The directory structure ($NET_CONF_DIR/baseline, $NET_CONF_DIR/current, etc.) has been recreated. The `baseline/router.conf` file is correctly in place with the known-good configuration and Unix line endings. The `current/router.conf` file has been created with the broken configuration and DOS line endings, as required. The `logs/patch_application.log` file has been created and initialized with the first log entry, 'BACKED_UP - OK', using the correct timestamp format.",

Save it to `patches/router_fix.patch`. I will also verify the content of the generated patch.\n4.  **Log**: Record the 'CREATED_PATCH' action.\n5.  **Metrics**: Create a JSON file `logs/metrics.json` containing the size of the *original* (pre-normalization) file (which is the `backups/router.conf.orig.gz` file) and the size of the generated patch file (`patches/router_fix.patch`).\n6.  **Apply**: Apply the patch to `current/router.conf`.\n7.  **Log**: Record the 'APPLIED_PATCH' action.\n8.  **Verify**: Ensure the file `current/router.conf` is now byte-for-byte identical to `baseline/router.conf`.\n9.  **Log**: Record the 'VERIFIED_CONFIG' action.",
