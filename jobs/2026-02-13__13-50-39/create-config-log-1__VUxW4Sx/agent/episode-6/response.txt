  "analysis": "The investigation reveals the cause of the patch failure. The 'diff -u baseline/router.conf current/router.conf' command generates a patch that converts the baseline file *into* the current file. When this patch is then applied *to* the current file, 'patch' correctly identifies it as a 'Reversed (or previously applied) patch' and skips application, leaving current/router.conf unchanged. For the patch to be applicable, the 'from' file in the diff command must be current/router.conf, and the 'to' file must be baseline/router.conf (i.e., 'diff -u current/router.conf baseline/router.conf'). The log file also contains premature 'OK' statuses for steps that failed. I will now correct the patch creation command and ensure log entries accurately reflect outcomes.",
  "plan": "I will use 'rm -f current/router.conf.rej' to clean up the rejected patch file. Then, I will correct the patch creation by running 'diff -u current/router.conf baseline/router.conf > patches/router_fix.patch' to generate a patch that transforms the normalized current file into the baseline file. I will verify the new patch's content. After this, I will attempt to apply this new, correctly oriented patch to current/router.conf. I will then update the log file entries for 'APPLIED_PATCH' and 'VERIFIED_CONFIG' to reflect the actual outcome of these operations. If the patch applies successfully and the files match, the task will be complete.",
