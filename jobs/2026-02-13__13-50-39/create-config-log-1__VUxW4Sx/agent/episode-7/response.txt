The patch was created with the correct orientation (from `current/router.conf` to `baseline/router.conf`) using `diff -u current/router.conf baseline/router.conf > patches/router_fix.patch`. This patch was then successfully applied to `current/router.conf` using `patch -N -p0 < patches/router_fix.patch`. The final verification using `diff -q baseline/router.conf current/router.conf` confirmed that the files are now identical. The log file `logs/patch_application.log` has been updated with the correct status for 'APPLIED_PATCH' (OK) and 'VERIFIED_CONFIG' (OK). All other files and metrics were correctly generated in previous steps.",
