  "analysis": "The `current/router.conf` and `baseline/router.conf` files have been created with the necessary content. The `file` utility is not available, so I will use `cat -A` to inspect line endings. The `current/router.conf` was created with DOS line endings (CRLF) as intended, and `baseline/router.conf` with Unix line endings (LF). The content appears correct. I can now proceed with the backup step.",
  "plan": "1. Verify the line endings of `current/router.conf` (should be DOS CRLF) and `baseline/router.conf` (should be Unix LF). 2. Create a compressed backup of the original `current/router.conf` using `gzip`. 3. Log the `BACKED_UP` action with a timestamp.",
