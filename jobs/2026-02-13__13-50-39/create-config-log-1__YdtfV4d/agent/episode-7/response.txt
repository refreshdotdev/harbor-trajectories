  "analysis": "The patch file `patches/router_fix.patch` has been successfully created. The `diff -u` output confirms it contains the required changes: changing IP address, changing `shutdown` to `no shutdown`, and adding the `network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0` line. The patch header format is standard. The next step is to apply this patch to `current/router.conf` and then verify its contents against `baseline/router.conf`.",
