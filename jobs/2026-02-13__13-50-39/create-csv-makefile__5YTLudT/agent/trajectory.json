      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Project Handover: Legacy Sales Data Pipeline\n\nYou are taking over a data pipeline task from a previous engineer who left abruptly. We need to automate the processing of some messy sales data using a GNU Makefile. \n\n**Directory Layout (Existing):**\n\n    /home/user/data_science_project/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 params.json\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 legacy_settings.yaml   <-- (IGNORE THIS, DEPRECATED)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 raw_data/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 batch_a.csv\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 batch_b.csv\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 .temp_cache            <-- (DO NOT TOUCH)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 scripts/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 cleanup.py             <-- (EMPTY, YOU MUST WRITE YOUR OWN)\n\n## Core Requirements\n\nCreate a `Makefile` at `/home/user/data_science_project/Makefile` that orchestrates the entire ETL process. The pipeline must be robust and handle the specific oddities of our data sources.\n\n### 1. Data Cleaning (`clean` target)\n\nWe need to process the CSV files in `raw_data/`. \n\n*   **Input Handling:** \n    *   `batch_a.csv` comes from our old mainframe. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1).\n    *   `batch_b.csv` comes from a Windows export. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and has a Byte Order Mark (BOM).\n    *   You must normalize both to UTF-8 before processing.\n\n*   **Filtering Logic:**\n    *   Drop any row where the `status` column (4th column) is \"Cancelled\" (case-insensitive).\n    *   Drop any row where the `amount` column (3rd column) is strictly less than the **Minimum Threshold**.\n    *   **Threshold Discovery:** Check if the environment variable `MIN_LIMIT` is set. If it is, use that value. If not, read the value from `config/params.json` (path: `policy.limits.min_amount`).\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**\n    *   The output files must be placed in a directory named `cleaned/`.\n    *   The output filename must correspond to the input (e.g., `batch_a.csv` \u2192 `batch_a.tsv`).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** The output format must be **Tab-Separated Values (TSV)**, not CSV.\n    *   **CRITICAL:** The line endings for the output files must be **CRLF** (Windows style), as these will be opened in Excel.\n    *   Preserve the header row.\n\n### 2. Analysis (`analyze` target)\n\nFor each cleaned TSV file, generate a corresponding JSON summary in a directory named `analysis/`.\n\n*   File naming: `batch_a.tsv` \u2192 `batch_a.json`\n*   Content format (minified JSON):\n    ```json\n    {\"source\": \"batch_a.tsv\", \"valid_rows\": 150, \"total_amount\": 1234.50}\n    ```\n    *   `valid_rows`: Number of data rows (excluding header).\n    *   `total_amount`: Sum of the `amount` column, formatted to exactly 2 decimal places.\n\n### 3. Packaging (`package` target)\n\nCreate a distribution archive named `delivery.tar.gz` in the project root.\n\n*   It must contain the `cleaned/` and `analysis/` directories.\n*   It must also contain a file named `manifest.md5` at the root of the archive. This file should list the MD5 checksums of all TSV files in the `cleaned/` directory. Format: standard `md5sum` output.\n\n### 4. Workflow Management\n\n*   **Targets:** The Makefile must declare `.PHONY` targets: `clean`, `analyze`, `package`, `all`.\n*   **Dependencies:** `all` triggers `package`. `package` needs `analyze`. `analyze` needs `clean`.\n*   **Logging:** \n    *   Every time a target recipe runs (clean, analyze, package), append a line to the file defined by the environment variable `PROJECT_LOG`. \n    *   If `PROJECT_LOG` is not set, default to `pipeline.log`.\n    *   Format: `[UNIX_TIMESTAMP_SECONDS] <TARGET_NAME>` (e.g., `[1678886000] clean`).\n\n## Important Constraints\n\n*   You may use Python 3, `awk`, `sed`, `iconv`, and standard utils.\n*   Do not modify the files in `raw_data/`.\n*   The Makefile must be idempotent.\n*   Be careful with the `amount` column; it may contain whitespace in the raw data.\n\nGood luck. The last guy couldn't figure out the encoding issues and got fired.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@6cb65ea0-7f70-4ac3-8a29-e64b3615b0e3:~/data_science_project#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
