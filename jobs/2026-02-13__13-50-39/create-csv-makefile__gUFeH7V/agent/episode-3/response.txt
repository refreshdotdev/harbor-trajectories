  "analysis": "The sample CSV files were created successfully. The terminal output shows both files exist in `raw_data/` and the `file` command output indicates `batch_a.csv` is ASCII text while `batch_b.csv` is UTF-8 text (which is expected since we used printf with tabs and CRLF). Now I need to test the data cleaning pipeline by running `make clean`.",
  "plan": "I'll execute `make clean` to process the CSV files. The Makefile should handle the encoding conversions, filtering based on the $100 minimum threshold from `params.json`, and output TSV files with CRLF line endings in the `cleaned/` directory. I'll then examine the resulting files to verify the transformations.",
