I can see that the monthly/ directory already exists and contains files, while the other directories have been created. The next step is to validate the CSV files in the monthly/ directory based on the rules defined in policy.ini, particularly focusing on filename patterns, minimum file sizes, and extracting authoritative timestamps from the content.",

Then I'll iterate through each file, check if it meets the filename pattern and size requirements, and extract the authoritative timestamp from the file content. This will allow me to sort the files chronologically as required.",
