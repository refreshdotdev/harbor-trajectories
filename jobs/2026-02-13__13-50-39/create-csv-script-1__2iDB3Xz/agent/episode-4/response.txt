  "analysis": "I can see six files in the monthly/ directory with various naming patterns and sizes. Based on the policy.ini configuration I created earlier (filename_pattern=^.*\\.csv$, min_size_bytes=1024), I need to validate which files are considered valid. The files cost_2023-08_draft.csv (24 bytes) and cost_2023-09_tiny.csv (24 bytes) appear to be too small, while old_data.txt doesn't match the CSV pattern. The other CSV files seem to be potential candidates for processing, but I must also extract and parse their authoritative timestamps from the content.",

After validation and sorting, I'll identify the Latest and Previous files for symlink creation and archiving purposes.",
