All CSV files are below the minimum size requirement of 1024 bytes, and the text file doesn't match the CSV pattern.

For symlink generation, since there are no valid files, I will create a placeholder script that can be used later when valid files become available. I'll also create the audit_chain.csv file structure and ensure all directory permissions are properly set up for the future processing pipeline.",
