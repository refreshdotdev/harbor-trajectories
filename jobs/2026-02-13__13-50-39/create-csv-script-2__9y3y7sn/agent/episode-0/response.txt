  "analysis": "I have been assigned a systems engineering task to process a legacy SSH audit log. The task involves cleaning up a data dump from a decommissioned mainframe, handling character encoding issues, applying renaming rules from a configuration file, and generating three specific output files with precise formatting and encoding requirements. The current terminal state shows I'm logged in as root, but I need to navigate to the working directory `/home/user/inventory` where the input files (`ssh_audit.csv` and `legacy_map.conf`) should be located.",
  "plan": "First, I will navigate to the specified working directory `/home/user/inventory`. Then, I'll verify the existence and basic properties of the input files (`ssh_audit.csv` and `legacy_map.conf`) to understand their contents and structure. This initial exploration will inform the subsequent processing steps.",
