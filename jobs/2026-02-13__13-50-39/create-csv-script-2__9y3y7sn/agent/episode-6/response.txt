  "analysis": "The `ssh_priority.tsv` file has been recreated correctly with a BOM and UTF-16LE encoding. The `column_manipulation.log` has been populated with the commands used for processing, using the correct mtime. Now, I need to verify the content and properties of all generated files: `ssh_root_status.txt`, `ssh_priority.tsv`, and `audit_manifest.json`, as well as the `column_manipulation.log`. This includes checking line endings, encodings, sorting, and file content.",
  "plan": "I will use a combination of `hexdump`, `cat` (for UTF-8 files), `file` (if available, though previously it wasn't), `sort -c`, and `wc` to inspect the generated files. For `ssh_root_status.txt`, I'll check for CRLF line endings and alphabetical sorting. For `ssh_priority.tsv`, I'll check for the BOM, UTF-16LE encoding, and correct sorting. For `audit_manifest.json`, I'll check its single-line JSON format. For `column_manipulation.log`, I'll check its content and timestamp format.",
