Generate `column_manipulation.log` with the correct ISO timestamp for each command that will be used later for deliverables. 4. Create an initial, empty `audit_manifest.json` file. 5. Prepare a base command string for CSV processing that includes encoding conversion and initial filtering, which will be reused for different deliverables.",
