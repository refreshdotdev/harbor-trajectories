The data is critical for an upcoming security audit. The previous engineer left abruptly, leaving behind a raw CSV file and a mapping configuration.\n\n## 1. Environment & Inputs\n\nYour working directory is `/home/user/inventory`. You will find two files:\n\n1.  `ssh_audit.csv`: The raw audit log. \n    *   **WARNING:** This file was generated by a legacy ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) system. It contains special characters (e.g., in the 'location' or 'owner' fields) that are not valid UTF-8. You must handle this encoding correctly during processing.\n    *   The file structure is: `serverName,port,permitRootLogin,protocol,owner,extra`\n    *   Lines starting with `#` are comments. However, due to a bug in the mainframe exporter, some comment lines have leading whitespace (e.g., `  # comment`). These must also be ignored.\n\n2.  `legacy_map.conf`: A renaming configuration file.\n    *   Format: `old_hostname -> new_hostname`\n    *   If a `serverName` from the CSV appears on the left side of an arrow in this file, you must output the `new_hostname` in all generated files.\n\n## 2. Processing Logic\n\nUsing **standard shell utilities only** (sed, awk, grep, sort, iconv, tr, cut, etc. are allowed; **NO** Python, Perl, Ruby, or C compiled code), generate the files described below.\n\n### Global Filtering & Transformation Rules\n1.  **Encoding:** Convert all output data to UTF-8, except where specified otherwise.\n2.  **Protocol Security:** Only include records where `protocol` is `2`. \n    *   *Exception:* If the server was renamed via `legacy_map.conf`, it is considered a \"legacy node\" and `protocol` `1` is also permitted for it.\n3.  **Root Login:** Normalize the `permitRootLogin` column:\n    *   `prohibit-password` becomes `without-password`.\n    *   `forced-commands-only` becomes `no`.\n\n## 3. Deliverables\n\nCreate the following three files in `/home/user/inventory`. Pay extreme attention to the encoding and line-ending requirements for each.\n\na) `ssh_root_status.txt`\n   *   **Format:** `serverName | permitRootLogin` (pipe surrounded by spaces).\n   *   **Sorting:** Alphabetical by `serverName` (A-Z).\n   *   **Line Endings:** This file is for a Windows-based dashboard. It must use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n   *   **Header:** None.\n\nb) `ssh_priority.tsv`\n   *   **Format:** Tab-separated values.\n   *   **Columns:** `port`, `serverName`, `owner`.\n   *   **Sorting:** Primary sort by `port` (numeric ascending). Secondary sort by `serverName` (descending Z-A).\n   *   **Header:** The first line must be the literal string `#PRIORITY_LIST` followed by a newline.\n   *   **Encoding:** This file must be encoded in **UTF-16LE** with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to be compatible with Excel import tools.\n\nc) `audit_manifest.json`\n   *   **Format:** A strict JSON object containing the row counts of the processed data.\n   *   **Content:** `{\"valid_records\": N, \"legacy_nodes_detected\": M}`\n       *   `N`: Total number of lines in `ssh_root_status.txt`.\n       *   `M`: Number of servers that were renamed using the mapping file.\n   *   **Formatting:** The JSON must be on a single line with no spaces between keys/values (e.g., `{\"key\":value}`).\n\n## 4. Verification Log\n\nCreate `/home/user/task_logs/column_manipulation.log`.\n*   This log tracks the *provenance* of the data.\n*   Format: `ISO_TIMESTAMP | COMMAND`\n*   **Crucial Requirement:** The timestamp used in this log must NOT be the current execution time. It must be the **Last Modification Time** of the source file (`ssh_audit.csv`) in ISO-8601 UTC format (e.g., `2023-11-05T08:00:00Z`). This links the output to the specific source version.\n*   Log the commands used to generate the three deliverables (3 lines total).\n\n## Success Criteria\n*   All files exist at exact paths.\n*   Encodings (Latin-1 input, UTF-16LE output, CRLF endings) are handled perfectly.\n*   Renaming logic from the mapping file is applied.\n*   Log timestamps match the source file's mtime, not current time.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@bff6ad84-8ae6-4892-9247-81dcae4b04d9:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The data is critical for an upcoming security audit. The previous engineer left abruptly, leaving behind a raw CSV file and a mapping configuration.\n\n## 1. Environment & Inputs\n\nYour working directory is `/home/user/inventory`. You will find two files:\n\n1.  `ssh_audit.csv`: The raw audit log. \n    *   **WARNING:** This file was generated by a legacy ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) system. It contains special characters (e.g., in the 'location' or 'owner' fields) that are not valid UTF-8. You must handle this encoding correctly during processing.\n    *   The file structure is: `serverName,port,permitRootLogin,protocol,owner,extra`\n    *   Lines starting with `#` are comments. However, due to a bug in the mainframe exporter, some comment lines have leading whitespace (e.g., `  # comment`). These must also be ignored.\n\n2.  `legacy_map.conf`: A renaming configuration file.\n    *   Format: `old_hostname -> new_hostname`\n    *   If a `serverName` from the CSV appears on the left side of an arrow in this file, you must output the `new_hostname` in all generated files.\n\n## 2. Processing Logic\n\nUsing **standard shell utilities only** (sed, awk, grep, sort, iconv, tr, cut, etc. are allowed; **NO** Python, Perl, Ruby, or C compiled code), generate the files described below.\n\n### Global Filtering & Transformation Rules\n1.  **Encoding:** Convert all output data to UTF-8, except where specified otherwise.\n2.  **Protocol Security:** Only include records where `protocol` is `2`. \n    *   *Exception:* If the server was renamed via `legacy_map.conf`, it is considered a \"legacy node\" and `protocol` `1` is also permitted for it.\n3.  **Root Login:** Normalize the `permitRootLogin` column:\n    *   `prohibit-password` becomes `without-password`.\n    *   `forced-commands-only` becomes `no`.\n\n## 3. Deliverables\n\nCreate the following three files in `/home/user/inventory`. Pay extreme attention to the encoding and line-ending requirements for each.\n\na) `ssh_root_status.txt`\n   *   **Format:** `serverName | permitRootLogin` (pipe surrounded by spaces).\n   *   **Sorting:** Alphabetical by `serverName` (A-Z).\n   *   **Line Endings:** This file is for a Windows-based dashboard. It must use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n   *   **Header:** None.\n\nb) `ssh_priority.tsv`\n   *   **Format:** Tab-separated values.\n   *   **Columns:** `port`, `serverName`, `owner`.\n   *   **Sorting:** Primary sort by `port` (numeric ascending). Secondary sort by `serverName` (descending Z-A).\n   *   **Header:** The first line must be the literal string `#PRIORITY_LIST` followed by a newline.\n   *   **Encoding:** This file must be encoded in **UTF-16LE** with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to be compatible with Excel import tools.\n\nc) `audit_manifest.json`\n   *   **Format:** A strict JSON object containing the row counts of the processed data.\n   *   **Content:** `{\"valid_records\": N, \"legacy_nodes_detected\": M}`\n       *   `N`: Total number of lines in `ssh_root_status.txt`.\n       *   `M`: Number of servers that were renamed using the mapping file.\n   *   **Formatting:** The JSON must be on a single line with no spaces between keys/values (e.g., `{\"key\":value}`).\n\n## 4. Verification Log\n\nCreate `/home/user/task_logs/column_manipulation.log`.\n*   This log tracks the *provenance* of the data.\n*   Format: `ISO_TIMESTAMP | COMMAND`\n*   **Crucial Requirement:** The timestamp used in this log must NOT be the current execution time. It must be the **Last Modification Time** of the source file (`ssh_audit.csv`) in ISO-8601 UTC format (e.g., `2023-11-05T08:00:00Z`). This links the output to the specific source version.\n*   Log the commands used to generate the three deliverables (3 lines total).\n\n## Success Criteria\n*   All files exist at exact paths.\n*   Encodings (Latin-1 input, UTF-16LE output, CRLF endings) are handled perfectly.\n*   Renaming logic from the mapping file is applied.\n*   Log timestamps match the source file's mtime, not current time.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@bff6ad84-8ae6-4892-9247-81dcae4b04d9:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds.
