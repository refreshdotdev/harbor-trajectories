There is also a commented line with leading whitespace that needs to be properly handled.\n\nThe CSV structure matches the specification with columns: serverName,port,permitRootLogin,protocol,owner,extra. I need to process this data according to the requirements, handling the Latin-1 encoding, filtering protocols, normalizing values, and generating the three output files with specific formats.",
  "plan": "I will begin processing the CSV data. The first step is to handle the file encoding by converting from Latin-1 to UTF-8 using iconv. Then I will filter out comment lines (both with and without leading whitespace) and apply the protocol filtering rules. After that, I will normalize the permitRootLogin values according to the specifications. Finally, I will generate the three output files with their specific formatting requirements.",
