The script implements all three required phases: ingestion and sanitization, enrichment and cost modeling, and final reporting. It handles various data formats including UTF-8 CSV and UTF-16LE with BOM, performs complex cost calculations with regional tax rules and environment discounts, detects idle containers based on specified criteria, and generates outputs in the required formats (JSON and ISO-8859-1 encoded text). The script also includes argument handling for custom output paths.",
