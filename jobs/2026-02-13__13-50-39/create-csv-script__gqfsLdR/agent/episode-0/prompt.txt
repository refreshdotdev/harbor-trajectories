You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# FinOps Workflow Update: Project Cost-Ray

**To:** FinOps Analyst
**From:** Director of Cloud Operations
**Subject:** Automated Cost Reporting Pipeline v2

We are upgrading our container cost tracking workflow. The previous ad-hoc reporting method is no longer audit-compliant. You need to build a robust, multi-stage pipeline script (`generate_cost_report.sh`) that ingests raw logs, sanitizes them, models the costs with our new regional tax rules, and produces a final legacy-compatible report.

## 1. Input Data Sources

The data is located in `/home/user/container_usage/`. Note that we are in the middle of a migration, so you will see multiple files. **Do not use the old `owners.csv` file**; it is deprecated. Use the new v2 export from the Windows Active Directory system (`owners_v2.csv`).

1.  **Usage Log** (`usage.log`):
    - Standard UTF-8 CSV.
    - Columns: `container_id,image,cpu_percent,mem_mb,runtime_hours,cost_per_hour`.
    - **Data Quality Warning:** Some sensors are misfiring. You may find string literals like "NULL" or "N/A" in numeric columns (`cpu_percent`, `mem_mb`). Treat these as `0`. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

2.  **Owners Registry** (`owners_v2.csv`):
    - This is a raw export from the new Windows-based system.
    - **Format:** It uses Semicolons (`;`) as delimiters, not commas.
    - **Encoding:** It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** with a BOM. You must handle this correctly.
    - Columns: `container_id;owner_email;environment;region`.

## 2. The Pipeline Specification

Your script must execute three distinct phases. All intermediate artifacts must be saved to `/home/user/data/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist).

### Phase 1: Ingestion & Sanitization
Read `usage.log`. Filter out comments. Sanitize any "NULL"/"N/A" values to `0`. Save the clean, normalized data to:
`/home/user/data/clean_usage.csv`
*Format: Standard CSV (comma-delimited), UTF-8, Header included.*

### Phase 2: Enrichment & Cost Modeling
Read `clean_usage.csv` and merge it with `owners_v2.csv` on `container_id`. If a container is not found in the owners file, assume Owner="Unknown", Env="prod", Region="global".

**Cost Calculation Logic:**
We have new business rules. Calculate costs in this specific order:
1.  **Base Cost:** `runtime_hours * cost_per_hour`.
2.  **Regional Tax:** Apply tax to the Base Cost based on the `region` column:
    - `eu-west`: Add **10%** tax.
    - `us-east`: **0%** tax (tax-free zone).
    - All other regions (including "global"): Add **5%** tax.
3.  **Environment Discount:** After adding tax, check the `environment`. If it is exactly `dev`, apply a **50% discount** to the *taxed* amount.

*Rounding: Round the final cost to 4 decimal places for the JSON model.*

**Idle Detection:**
A container is "Idle" if `cpu_percent` <= 5.0 **AND** `mem_mb` < 512. (Note: High memory usage implies active caching, so it's not idle even if CPU is low).

**Output:**
Generate a JSON file at `/home/user/data/cost_model.json`. 
Structure:
```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "generated": "<ISO-8601 Timestamp>",
    "source_hash": "<SHA256 checksum of clean_usage.csv>"
  },
  "data": [
    { "container_id": "...", "total_cost": 12.3456, "is_idle": true, ... },
    ...
  ]
}
```
*The `source_hash` is critical for our audit chain. It must be the lowercase hex digest of the Phase 1 output file.*

### Phase 3: Final Reporting
Read the JSON model from Phase 2 and generate the human-readable report at:
`/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt`

**Critical Constraint:** The finance mainframe that ingests this report requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for the final text report.

**Report Layout:**
```text
FinOps Cost Report (v2)
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Container | Region | Tax | Cost
---------------------------------
<rows sorted by Cost Descending>

Summary
=======
Active Containers: <int>
Idle Containers: <int>
Total Cost: $<float with 2 decimals>

[Integrity Hash: <MD5 checksum of cost_model.json>]
```

**Formatting Rules:**
- The table columns are pipe-separated but aligned? No, just pipe-delimited: `id | region | tax_rate | final_cost`.
- `tax_rate` should be displayed as a percentage (e.g., `10%`, `5%`, `0%`).
- `final_cost` in the table: 2 decimal places.
- The footer `[Integrity Hash: ...]` must contain the MD5 hex digest of the `cost_model.json` file generated in Phase 2. This ensures the report matches the JSON model exactly.

## 3. Deliverables

1.  `/home/user/bin/generate_cost_report.sh` (Executable, POSIX-compliant entry point).
2.  `/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt` (The final output).
3.  The intermediate files in `/home/user/data/` must exist after execution.

The script should handle arguments: if no argument is provided, write to the default path. If a file path is provided as output, write the report there (and still generate the intermediates in `~/data/`).

Good luck. The auditors are watching.
