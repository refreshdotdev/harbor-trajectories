  "analysis": "All three phases of the FinOps cost reporting pipeline have been successfully implemented in the generate_cost_report.sh script. The script now handles input validation, data sanitization, complex cost calculations, JSON generation with proper metadata, and final report formatting with ISO-8859-1 encoding. The script meets all specified requirements including argument handling, intermediate file generation, and integrity hashing.",
  "plan": "The solution is complete. The script implements all required functionality: Phase 1 (data ingestion and sanitization), Phase 2 (enrichment and cost modeling), and Phase 3 (final reporting with proper encoding). The script structure includes error handling, proper file encoding conversions, and meets all format specifications. No further implementation is needed.",
