The task requires setting up a workspace for SQL query log analysis, creating a Python virtual environment with specific dependencies, writing a Python script to process query logs according to strict specifications, and finally running this script for a given date and displaying a JSON report. No work has been done yet.",
  "plan": "1. Create the workspace directory `/home/user/query_optimization` and navigate into it. 2. Set up the Python virtual environment at `/home/user/query_optimization/env` with `sqlparse==0.4.4` and `psycopg2-binary==2.9.7`. 3. Create the Python script `analyze_and_optimize.py` with the required functionality: reading configuration, parsing logs, filtering queries, writing a CSV file with specific encoding and line endings, generating a SHA-256 hash of the CSV, analyzing and normalizing SQL queries, suggesting indexes, and producing a JSON report. 4. Run the script for the date `2023-03-15`. 5. Display the contents of the generated `report.json` file.",
