  "analysis": "The script failed to run due to an ImportError: `cannot import name 'Keyword' from 'sqlparse.sql'`. This indicates that the `Keyword` class is not directly importable from `sqlparse.sql` in the installed version of `sqlparse`. The report.json file was not generated because the script exited prematurely.",
  "plan": "I need to fix the import statement for `sqlparse.sql.Keyword`. Instead of trying to import `Keyword` directly as a top-level class from `sqlparse.sql`, I should use the `sqlparse.tokens.Keyword` import path as suggested by the error or adjust the logic if `Keyword` was intended as a generic token type. Since the `DML` import also failed in a similar way in my thought process (not shown in output but is a common issue), I will correct both `Keyword` and `DML` imports. I will also add a check to see if the config file exists before running the script. After fixing the import, I will re-run the script.",
