The system is old, quirky, and strictly specifies how data must be processed to ensure compatibility with downstream auditing tools.\n\n## 1. Workspace & Configuration\n\nYour analysis must take place in `/home/user/query_optimization`. \n\nUnlike modern systems, this application does not use standard paths. You must locate the configuration file at `/home/user/db_tools/db_config.ini`. This file contains the absolute path to the log file (`log_file_path`) and a performance threshold (`min_duration_ms`). \n\n**Do not hardcode the log path or threshold.** Your script must read them from the config file at runtime.\n\n## 2. Python Environment\n\nYou must create an isolated virtual environment at `/home/user/query_optimization/env` containing exactly these packages:\n- `sqlparse==0.4.4`\n- `psycopg2-binary==2.9.7`\n\n## 3. The Analysis Script\n\nCreate a script at `/home/user/query_optimization/analyze_and_optimize.py`. The script must accept a `--date` argument (format `YYYY-MM-DD`).\n\n### Phase 1: Filtering & Staging (The Audit Trail)\n\nThe log file is pipe-delimited. Each line follows this format:\n`TIMESTAMP | DURATION | [LEVEL] | MESSAGE`\n\nExample:\n`2023-01-01T12:00:00Z | 15ms | [QUERY] | SELECT * FROM users;`\n\nYou must parse the log file defined in the config and filter for queries that meet **ALL** of the following criteria:\n1.  **Date Match:** The timestamp occurs on the date provided via the `--date` argument.\n2.  **Type Match:** The level is exactly `[QUERY]`.\n3.  **Performance Threshold:** The query duration (e.g., \"15ms\") is **greater than or equal to** the `min_duration_ms` value found in `db_config.ini`.\n\n**Output Requirement:**\nAll qualifying queries must be written to a staging file at `/home/user/query_optimization/staging/raw_extract.csv`.\n-   **Directory:** You must create the `staging` directory if it doesn't exist.\n-   **Format:** Standard CSV with a header row: `timestamp,duration_ms,query_text`.\n-   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in `ISO-8859-1` (Latin-1) to support legacy Windows viewers.\n-   **Line Endings:** The file **must** use CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n-   **Ordering:** Preserve the order from the original log file.\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis & Normalization\n\nOnce the staging file is written, you must compute its **SHA-256 checksum**. This checksum proves to the auditor that the analysis is based on the exact data extracted.\n\nNext, process the queries from your staging data:\n1.  **Normalize:** Use `sqlparse` to format the SQL with `keyword_case='upper'`, `strip_comments=True`, and `reindent=False`. Remove any trailing semicolons.\n2.  **Deduplicate:** Count occurrences based on the *normalized* SQL string.\n3.  **Suggest Indexes:** For each unique normalized query, suggest an index:\n    -   Extract the table and columns from the `WHERE` clause.\n    -   Support simple equality (`col = val`) and `AND` conditions.\n    -   Format: `CREATE INDEX idx_<table>_<cols> ON <table>(<cols>);` (cols separated by underscores in name, commas in definition).\n\n### Phase 3: Reporting\n\nGenerate a final JSON report at `/home/user/query_optimization/report.json`.\n-   **Encoding:** UTF-8.\n-   **Line Endings:** Unix (`\\n`).\n-   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"date_analyzed\": \"<YYYY-MM-DD>\",\n        \"staging_file_sha256\": \"<hex_hash_of_the_csv_file>\"\n      },\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"total_queries_extracted\": <int>,\n        \"unique_patterns\": <int>\n      },\n      \"suggestions\": [\n        {\n           \"id\": \"<timestamp_of_first_occurrence>\",\n           \"normalized_sql\": \"<string>\",\n           \"index_suggestion\": \"<string>\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n-   **Sorting:** The `suggestions` list must be sorted chronologically by the `id` (timestamp) of the first occurrence.\n\n## 4. Execution\n\nFinally, run your script for the date `2023-03-15` and display the contents of `report.json` to stdout.\n\n## Constraints & Traps\n-   The log file may contain messy whitespace around the pipes `|`.\n-   The duration field in the log always ends with `ms`.\n-   Queries may contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., names in Latin-1).\n-   The grader checks the binary exactness of the CSV (CRLF, encoding) and the cryptographic hash in the JSON.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e18e87cd-d242-4dd1-8ab5-bba6b7ab15c2:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# SQL Query Log Analysis & Optimization Task\n\nYou are a database administrator tasked with analyzing a legacy application's query logs to identify performance bottlenecks. The system is old, quirky, and strictly specifies how data must be processed to ensure compatibility with downstream auditing tools.\n\n## 1. Workspace & Configuration\n\nYour analysis must take place in `/home/user/query_optimization`. \n\nUnlike modern systems, this application does not use standard paths. You must locate the configuration file at `/home/user/db_tools/db_config.ini`. This file contains the absolute path to the log file (`log_file_path`) and a performance threshold (`min_duration_ms`). \n\n**Do not hardcode the log path or threshold.** Your script must read them from the config file at runtime.\n\n## 2. Python Environment\n\nYou must create an isolated virtual environment at `/home/user/query_optimization/env` containing exactly these packages:\n- `sqlparse==0.4.4`\n- `psycopg2-binary==2.9.7`\n\n## 3. The Analysis Script\n\nCreate a script at `/home/user/query_optimization/analyze_and_optimize.py`. The script must accept a `--date` argument (format `YYYY-MM-DD`).\n\n### Phase 1: Filtering & Staging (The Audit Trail)\n\nThe log file is pipe-delimited. Each line follows this format:\n`TIMESTAMP | DURATION | [LEVEL] | MESSAGE`\n\nExample:\n`2023-01-01T12:00:00Z | 15ms | [QUERY] | SELECT * FROM users;`\n\nYou must parse the log file defined in the config and filter for queries that meet **ALL** of the following criteria:\n1.  **Date Match:** The timestamp occurs on the date provided via the `--date` argument.\n2.  **Type Match:** The level is exactly `[QUERY]`.\n3.  **Performance Threshold:** The query duration (e.g., \"15ms\") is **greater than or equal to** the `min_duration_ms` value found in `db_config.ini`.\n\n**Output Requirement:**\nAll qualifying queries must be written to a staging file at `/home/user/query_optimization/staging/raw_extract.csv`.\n-   **Directory:** You must create the `staging` directory if it doesn't exist.\n-   **Format:** Standard CSV with a header row: `timestamp,duration_ms,query_text`.\n-   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in `ISO-8859-1` (Latin-1) to support legacy Windows viewers.\n-   **Line Endings:** The file **must** use CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n-   **Ordering:** Preserve the order from the original log file.\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis & Normalization\n\nOnce the staging file is written, you must compute its **SHA-256 checksum**. This checksum proves to the auditor that the analysis is based on the exact data extracted.\n\nNext, process the queries from your staging data:\n1.  **Normalize:** Use `sqlparse` to format the SQL with `keyword_case='upper'`, `strip_comments=True`, and `reindent=False`. Remove any trailing semicolons.\n2.  **Deduplicate:** Count occurrences based on the *normalized* SQL string.\n3.  **Suggest Indexes:** For each unique normalized query, suggest an index:\n    -   Extract the table and columns from the `WHERE` clause.\n    -   Support simple equality (`col = val`) and `AND` conditions.\n    -   Format: `CREATE INDEX idx_<table>_<cols> ON <table>(<cols>);` (cols separated by underscores in name, commas in definition).\n\n### Phase 3: Reporting\n\nGenerate a final JSON report at `/home/user/query_optimization/report.json`.\n-   **Encoding:** UTF-8.\n-   **Line Endings:** Unix (`\\n`).\n-   **Structure:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"date_analyzed\": \"<YYYY-MM-DD>\",\n        \"staging_file_sha256\": \"<hex_hash_of_the_csv_file>\"\n      },\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"total_queries_extracted\": <int>,\n        \"unique_patterns\": <int>\n      },\n      \"suggestions\": [\n        {\n           \"id\": \"<timestamp_of_first_occurrence>\",\n           \"normalized_sql\": \"<string>\",\n           \"index_suggestion\": \"<string>\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n-   **Sorting:** The `suggestions` list must be sorted chronologically by the `id` (timestamp) of the first occurrence.\n\n## 4. Execution\n\nFinally, run your script for the date `2023-03-15` and display the contents of `report.json` to stdout.\n\n## Constraints & Traps\n-   The log file may contain messy whitespace around the pipes `|`.\n-   The duration field in the log always ends with `ms`.\n-   Queries may contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., names in Latin-1).\n-   The grader checks the binary exactness of the CSV (CRLF, encoding) and the cryptographic hash in the JSON.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e18e87cd-d242-4dd1-8ab5-bba6b7ab15c2:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
