The task requires me to set up a workspace at /home/user/query_optimization, read configuration from /home/user/db_tools/db_config.ini, create an isolated Python virtual environment with specific packages, and develop a Python script to analyze SQL query logs. No prior work has been done in this session.",

Next, I'll create the virtual environment and install the required packages. After that, I'll create the Python analysis script. Finally, I'll execute the script for the specified date and display the results.",
