The task has been successfully completed according to the requirements:

**Analysis of Final State:**
1.  **Processing**: All 5 `.sql` files in `/home/user/db_backups` have been processed and replaced with their corresponding `.gz` files. The non-SQL file `batch_config.txt` remains untouched.
2.  **Normalization & Compression**: The Python script correctly normalized each file (removing BOM and trimming trailing whitespace) before compressing it. The compressed files retain their original names with a `.gz` extension.
3.  **Manifest**: The `manifest.json` file exists in `/home/user/backup_logs` and contains the correct filename-to-normalized-size mappings (6 lines including newline).
4.  **Compliance Report**: The `compliance_report.log` has been generated with the correct Batch ID header, sorted file records (custom collation applied), and the manifest's SHA256 footer. The report uses Windows-style CRLF line endings.

All deliverables are in place and meet the specified requirements.

**Plan:**
No further actions are needed as the task is complete.

**Commands:**
No further commands are required.
