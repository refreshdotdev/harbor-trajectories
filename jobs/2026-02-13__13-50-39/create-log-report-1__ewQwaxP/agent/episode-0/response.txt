I have not begun any steps yet.",

Activate the virtual environment and install requests==2.31.0. 4. Uninstall the wheel package. 5. Create the rotation_logs directory. 6. Run pip freeze and save its output to after_uninstall_freeze.txt. 7. Generate a SHA256 checksum of the freeze file and save it in a properly formatted line. 8. Set permissions to 0400 (read-only for owner) on both files. 9. Verify the environment is working correctly.",
