The task requires creating a specific directory structure under `/home/user/datasets/organized`, processing files from `/home/user/datasets/raw`, and generating log and summary files. The first step is to navigate to the appropriate directory and begin setting up the output hierarchy.",
  "plan": "I will start by navigating to the `/home/user/datasets` directory. Then, I will create the required output hierarchy including the directories `png_large`, `jpg_old`, `misc_small`, and the files `organize_log.tsv` and `summary.json`. After setting up the structure, I will prepare the environment by initializing variables for counts and total bytes, and by creating an empty TSV log file. Finally, I will craft a comprehensive `find` command to process all files recursively from `/home/user/datasets/raw` in alphabetical order, applying the specified selection rules, exclusions, and collision handling logic, and then populate the log and summary files.",
