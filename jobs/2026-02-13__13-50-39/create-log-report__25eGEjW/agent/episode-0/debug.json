Output Hierarchy\nCreate an output hierarchy `/home/user/datasets/organized` with **exactly** these items:\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/png_large`\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/jpg_old`\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/misc_small`\n*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`\n*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json`\n\n### 2. File Selection & Priority Rules\nProcess every file in `/home/user/datasets/raw` (recursively). To ensure deterministic behavior, you must process source files in **alphabetical order of their absolute paths**.\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Skip any broken symbolic links.\n*   Skip any files with permission mode `000` (no permissions).\n\n**Categories (Priority Order):**\n1.  **png_large**: Move every `*.png` file strictly larger than **1,000,000 bytes**.\n2.  **jpg_old**: Copy (preserve attributes) every `*.jpg` file with a modification time strictly before Unix Epoch **1625097600** (July 1, 2021).\n3.  **misc_small**: Copy (preserve attributes) every remaining regular file (any extension) that is **\u2264 512,000 bytes** AND does **not** have a `.txt` extension.\n\n### 3. Collision Handling\nPreserve filenames generally. However, if a file with the target name *already exists* in the destination folder (due to a file from an earlier processed source directory):\n*   Rename the **current** incoming file to: `{stem}_{parent_folder_name}.{extension}`\n*   *Example:* If `img.png` exists, and you are processing `.../projectB/img.png`, the new name becomes `img_projectB.png`.\n\n### 4. Logging & Reporting\n\n**A) TSV Log**\nCreate a tab-separated log at `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`.\n*   Columns: `original_path`, `new_absolute_path`, `size_bytes`, `mtime_epoch`, `md5_hash`\n*   `size_bytes` and `mtime_epoch` must match the destination file.\n*   `md5_hash` is the MD5 checksum of the file content.\n*   The file must be **sorted alphabetically** by the `new_absolute_path` column.\n*   No header line.\n\n**B) Summary JSON**\nCreate a JSON file at `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json` containing exactly these keys:\n```json\n{\n  \"moved_count\": <integer>,\n  \"copied_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer>\n}\n```\n*   `moved_count`: Number of files moved (Rule 1).\n*   `copied_count`: Number of files copied (Rules 2 & 3).\n*   `total_bytes`: Sum of the size (in bytes) of all resulting files in the organized folders.\n\n### Verification Hints\n*   Moved PNGs must no longer exist in `raw`.\n*   Copied files must still exist in `raw`.\n*   Timestamps on copied files must match their originals.\n*   Ensure your collision logic uses the immediate parent directory name of the source file.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@fc3b6b1b-89a5-4d40-83c5-d146a3dc8344:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After that, I'll navigate to the parent directory of the raw dataset to begin processing. The core of the task involves a complex `find` command to locate files, sort them, and then a `while` loop to process each file individually based on the given rules (exclusions, priority categories, collision handling, and logging). Finally, I'll calculate the total bytes and update the summary JSON.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/datasets/organized/png_large /home/user/datasets/organized/jpg_old /home/user/datasets/organized/misc_small\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"touch /home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > /home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json << EOF\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"moved_count\\\\\\\": 0,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"copied_count\\\\\\\": 0,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"total_bytes\\\\\\\": 0\\\\n}\\\\nEOF\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd /home/user\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\\n```\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1418,\"completion_tokens\":402,\"total_tokens\":1820,\"cost\":0.00034514,\"is_byok\":false,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":0.00034514,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.00018434,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0001608},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0}}}",
