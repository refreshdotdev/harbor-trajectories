You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are helping a researcher tidy-up a scattered image dataset that lives under `/home/user/datasets/raw`.

### 1. Output Hierarchy
Create an output hierarchy `/home/user/datasets/organized` with **exactly** these items:
*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/png_large`
*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/jpg_old`
*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/misc_small`
*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`
*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json`

### 2. File Selection & Priority Rules
Process every file in `/home/user/datasets/raw` (recursively). To ensure deterministic behavior, you must process source files in **alphabetical order of their absolute paths**.

**Exclusions:**
*   Skip any broken symbolic links.
*   Skip any files with permission mode `000` (no permissions).

**Categories (Priority Order):**
1.  **png_large**: Move every `*.png` file strictly larger than **1,000,000 bytes**.
2.  **jpg_old**: Copy (preserve attributes) every `*.jpg` file with a modification time strictly before Unix Epoch **1625097600** (July 1, 2021).
3.  **misc_small**: Copy (preserve attributes) every remaining regular file (any extension) that is **≤ 512,000 bytes** AND does **not** have a `.txt` extension.

### 3. Collision Handling
Preserve filenames generally. However, if a file with the target name *already exists* in the destination folder (due to a file from an earlier processed source directory):
*   Rename the **current** incoming file to: `{stem}_{parent_folder_name}.{extension}`
*   *Example:* If `img.png` exists, and you are processing `.../projectB/img.png`, the new name becomes `img_projectB.png`.

### 4. Logging & Reporting

**A) TSV Log**
Create a tab-separated log at `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`.
*   Columns: `original_path`, `new_absolute_path`, `size_bytes`, `mtime_epoch`, `md5_hash`
*   `size_bytes` and `mtime_epoch` must match the destination file.
*   `md5_hash` is the MD5 checksum of the file content.
*   The file must be **sorted alphabetically** by the `new_absolute_path` column.
*   No header line.

**B) Summary JSON**
Create a JSON file at `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json` containing exactly these keys:
```json
{
  "moved_count": <integer>,
  "copied_count": <integer>,
  "total_bytes": <integer>
}
```
*   `moved_count`: Number of files moved (Rule 1).
*   `copied_count`: Number of files copied (Rules 2 & 3).
*   `total_bytes`: Sum of the size (in bytes) of all resulting files in the organized folders.

### Verification Hints
*   Moved PNGs must no longer exist in `raw`.
*   Copied files must still exist in `raw`.
*   Timestamps on copied files must match their originals.
*   Ensure your collision logic uses the immediate parent directory name of the source file.
