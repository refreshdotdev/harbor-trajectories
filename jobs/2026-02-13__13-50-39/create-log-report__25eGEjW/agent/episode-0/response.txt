  "analysis": "The current state is a clean terminal session on a Linux environment. No prior work has been done on the dataset organization task. The task requires creating a specific output hierarchy, processing image files from `/home/user/datasets/raw` recursively according to defined rules, handling collisions, and generating a TSV log and a JSON summary.",
  "plan": "First, I will create the necessary output directory structure for the organized dataset. Then, I'll ensure the working environment is set up by creating an empty log file and initializing a summary JSON file with zero counts. After that, I'll navigate to the parent directory of the raw dataset to begin processing. The core of the task involves a complex `find` command to locate files, sort them, and then a `while` loop to process each file individually based on the given rules (exclusions, priority categories, collision handling, and logging). Finally, I'll calculate the total bytes and update the summary JSON.",
