The previous response was marked as `task_complete: true`, and the system is prompting for confirmation. Based on the terminal output:
1.  The directory structure and initial files were created.
2.  The `find` command to list files and the main processing loop seem to have run. Several "Skipping broken link" messages were printed, indicating that part of the logic worked.
3.  However, commands relying on `jq` and `sponge` (for updating `summary.json` and calculating `total_bytes`) failed because these utilities were not found on the system.
4.  The `organize_log.tsv` file was sorted.
5.  The temporary file `/tmp/sorted_files.txt` was removed.
6.  The final `summary.json` still contains the initial zero values because the `jq` commands could not update it.

The task is **not** complete. The `summary.json` is incorrect, and the `total_bytes` were not calculated or added. The core processing logic (moving/copying files) might have partially worked, but the logging and summary generation are incomplete due to missing dependencies.

{
  "analysis": "The script execution revealed that `jq` and `sponge` utilities are not installed on the system, causing failures in updating the `summary.json` file and calculating the `total_bytes`. The `summary.json` still contains the initial zero values. The `organize_log.tsv` file was sorted. Several files were reported as 'broken link' and skipped. The task is not fully complete as the summary is incorrect and total bytes are missing.",
  "plan": "The immediate plan is to address the dependency issue. First, I will check if `jq` is available or can be installed. If `jq` is not available, an alternative method for updating the JSON summary will be needed. The `total_bytes` calculation also needs to be adjusted if `jq` is not available for the final update. Since the main processing loop has already run, these commands will focus on repairing the summary.",
