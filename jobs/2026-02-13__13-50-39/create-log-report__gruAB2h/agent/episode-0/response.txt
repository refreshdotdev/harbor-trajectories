The task requires creating a specific output directory structure, processing image files from `/home/user/datasets/raw` based on given rules, handling file collisions by renaming, and generating detailed logs and a summary JSON file.",
  "plan": "First, I will establish the necessary directory structure for the organized dataset. I'll create the main output directory `/home/user/datasets/organized` and then the subdirectories `png_large`, `jpg_old`, and `misc_small` within it. I will also create the placeholder files `organize_log.tsv` and `summary.json` so their paths are defined for later updates. Subsequent steps will involve finding and processing the raw image files.",
