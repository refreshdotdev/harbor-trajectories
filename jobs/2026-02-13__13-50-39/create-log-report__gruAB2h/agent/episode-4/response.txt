The `summary.json` file contains unexpanded shell variables ($MOVED_COUNT, $COPIED_COUNT, $TOTAL_BYTES) instead of the actual numerical values. Additionally, the `organize_log.tsv` file appears to have correct entries based on the snippet shown. The xargs warnings during MD5 hash updates indicate potential issues with the sed replacement command, but the overall structure of the organized files and directories seems correct.",
  "plan": "To correct the `summary.json` file, I will create a revised JSON string with the actual counts and byte totals. I'll extract these values by counting files and summing sizes in the organized directories. I will then overwrite the existing `summary.json` file with this corrected content.",
