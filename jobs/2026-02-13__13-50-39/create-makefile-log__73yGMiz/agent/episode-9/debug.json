            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a network engineer who wants a repeatable way to test basic connectivity on any Linux host. \nCreate a tiny automation project that lives entirely inside `/home/user/netdiag`\n\n1.  **Directory layout that must exist at the end of the task**\n    ```\n    /home/user/netdiag/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.log   (created by running the Makefile)\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.bak   (created only if rotation occurs)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Makefile functional requirements**\n\n    a.  **Environment Variable Configuration**\n        The target IP address MUST NOT be hardcoded. \n        The Makefile must read the target IP from an environment variable named `TARGET_IP`.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is defined, use that value.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is NOT defined, default to `127.0.0.1`.\n\n    b.  **Log Rotation (Pre-flight)**\n        Before running any tests, the default goal must check the size of `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log` (if it exists).\n        *   If the file size is **greater than 500 bytes**, rename the existing file to `loopback.bak` (overwrite any existing .bak file), then start a fresh `loopback.log`.\n        *   If the file is smaller or doesn't exist, simply append to the existing `loopback.log`.\n\n    c.  **Default goal**\n        Typing \u201cmake\u201d (with no target) MUST execute the rotation check, write a session header, then execute the ping test, then the traceroute test.\n\n    d.  **Individual targets**\n        i.   `ping` \u2013 performs a 3-packet ping to the target IP.\n             *   **Filtering**: The output MUST be filtered to ONLY show lines containing the substring \"bytes from\" (case-insensitive). Do not log the ping header or statistics footer.\n        ii.  `trace` \u2013 performs a maximum-3-hop traceroute to the target IP.\n\n    e.  **Logging rules**\n        *   Every target MUST append its output to `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log`.\n        *   **Session Header**: At the very start of the default `make` execution (after rotation but before ping), append a session line:\n            ```\n            >>> SESSION: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\n            ```\n            (Use UTC ISO 8601 format, e.g., `2024-03-15T10:00:00Z`).\n        *   Each command section MUST start with an exact header line followed by the command output and a delimiter line.\n            Required header / delimiter text:\n            ```\n            >>> PING START\n            >>> PING END\n            >>> TRACE START\n            >>> TRACE END\n            ```\n        *   The required order inside `loopback.log` for a full run is:\n            1.  `>>> SESSION: ...`\n            2.  `>>> PING START`\n            3.  (Filtered ping output)\n            4.  `>>> PING END`\n            5.  `>>> TRACE START`\n            6.  (Traceroute output)\n            7.  `>>> TRACE END`\n\n3.  **Verification / what the grader will check**\n    *   `/home/user/netdiag/Makefile` exists.\n    *   Running \u201cmake\u201d respects `TARGET_IP`.\n    *   Rotation occurs correctly when the log file exceeds 500 bytes.\n    *   The ping output in the log does NOT contain the standard \"PING 127.0.0.1...\" header line, only the response lines.\n    *   The log file contains the session header with a valid timestamp.\n\n4.  **What you need to do**\n    *   Create the directory tree.\n    *   Author the Makefile that satisfies all rules above. (Assume `ping`, `traceroute`, `date`, `stat`, and `grep` are available.)\n    *   Run the Makefile once so that `loopback.log` is produced.\n\n5.  **IMPORTANT formatting reminder**\n    The grader is strict about the marker lines and the session header format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Ensure your `date` command produces exactly this string.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b8e6a0ea-0acd-4c20-a887-0b32e764c8d9:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a network engineer who wants a repeatable way to test basic connectivity on any Linux host. \nCreate a tiny automation project that lives entirely inside `/home/user/netdiag`\n\n1.  **Directory layout that must exist at the end of the task**\n    ```\n    /home/user/netdiag/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.log   (created by running the Makefile)\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.bak   (created only if rotation occurs)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Makefile functional requirements**\n\n    a.  **Environment Variable Configuration**\n        The target IP address MUST NOT be hardcoded. \n        The Makefile must read the target IP from an environment variable named `TARGET_IP`.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is defined, use that value.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is NOT defined, default to `127.0.0.1`.\n\n    b.  **Log Rotation (Pre-flight)**\n        Before running any tests, the default goal must check the size of `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log` (if it exists).\n        *   If the file size is **greater than 500 bytes**, rename the existing file to `loopback.bak` (overwrite any existing .bak file), then start a fresh `loopback.log`.\n        *   If the file is smaller or doesn't exist, simply append to the existing `loopback.log`.\n\n    c.  **Default goal**\n        Typing \u201cmake\u201d (with no target) MUST execute the rotation check, write a session header, then execute the ping test, then the traceroute test.\n\n    d.  **Individual targets**\n        i.   `ping` \u2013 performs a 3-packet ping to the target IP.\n             *   **Filtering**: The output MUST be filtered to ONLY show lines containing the substring \"bytes from\" (case-insensitive). Do not log the ping header or statistics footer.\n        ii.  `trace` \u2013 performs a maximum-3-hop traceroute to the target IP.\n\n    e.  **Logging rules**\n        *   Every target MUST append its output to `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log`.\n        *   **Session Header**: At the very start of the default `make` execution (after rotation but before ping), append a session line:\n            ```\n            >>> SESSION: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\n            ```\n            (Use UTC ISO 8601 format, e.g., `2024-03-15T10:00:00Z`).\n        *   Each command section MUST start with an exact header line followed by the command output and a delimiter line.\n            Required header / delimiter text:\n            ```\n            >>> PING START\n            >>> PING END\n            >>> TRACE START\n            >>> TRACE END\n            ```\n        *   The required order inside `loopback.log` for a full run is:\n            1.  `>>> SESSION: ...`\n            2.  `>>> PING START`\n            3.  (Filtered ping output)\n            4.  `>>> PING END`\n            5.  `>>> TRACE START`\n            6.  (Traceroute output)\n            7.  `>>> TRACE END`\n\n3.  **Verification / what the grader will check**\n    *   `/home/user/netdiag/Makefile` exists.\n    *   Running \u201cmake\u201d respects `TARGET_IP`.\n    *   Rotation occurs correctly when the log file exceeds 500 bytes.\n    *   The ping output in the log does NOT contain the standard \"PING 127.0.0.1...\" header line, only the response lines.\n    *   The log file contains the session header with a valid timestamp.\n\n4.  **What you need to do**\n    *   Create the directory tree.\n    *   Author the Makefile that satisfies all rules above. (Assume `ping`, `traceroute`, `date`, `stat`, and `grep` are available.)\n    *   Run the Makefile once so that `loopback.log` is produced.\n\n5.  **IMPORTANT formatting reminder**\n    The grader is strict about the marker lines and the session header format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Ensure your `date` command produces exactly this string.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b8e6a0ea-0acd-4c20-a887-0b32e764c8d9:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a network engineer who wants a repeatable way to test basic connectivity on any Linux host. \nCreate a tiny automation project that lives entirely inside `/home/user/netdiag`\n\n1.  **Directory layout that must exist at the end of the task**\n    ```\n    /home/user/netdiag/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.log   (created by running the Makefile)\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 loopback.bak   (created only if rotation occurs)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Makefile functional requirements**\n\n    a.  **Environment Variable Configuration**\n        The target IP address MUST NOT be hardcoded. \n        The Makefile must read the target IP from an environment variable named `TARGET_IP`.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is defined, use that value.\n        *   If `TARGET_IP` is NOT defined, default to `127.0.0.1`.\n\n    b.  **Log Rotation (Pre-flight)**\n        Before running any tests, the default goal must check the size of `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log` (if it exists).\n        *   If the file size is **greater than 500 bytes**, rename the existing file to `loopback.bak` (overwrite any existing .bak file), then start a fresh `loopback.log`.\n        *   If the file is smaller or doesn't exist, simply append to the existing `loopback.log`.\n\n    c.  **Default goal**\n        Typing \u201cmake\u201d (with no target) MUST execute the rotation check, write a session header, then execute the ping test, then the traceroute test.\n\n    d.  **Individual targets**\n        i.   `ping` \u2013 performs a 3-packet ping to the target IP.\n             *   **Filtering**: The output MUST be filtered to ONLY show lines containing the substring \"bytes from\" (case-insensitive). Do not log the ping header or statistics footer.\n        ii.  `trace` \u2013 performs a maximum-3-hop traceroute to the target IP.\n\n    e.  **Logging rules**\n        *   Every target MUST append its output to `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log`.\n        *   **Session Header**: At the very start of the default `make` execution (after rotation but before ping), append a session line:\n            ```\n            >>> SESSION: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\n            ```\n            (Use UTC ISO 8601 format, e.g., `2024-03-15T10:00:00Z`).\n        *   Each command section MUST start with an exact header line followed by the command output and a delimiter line.\n            Required header / delimiter text:\n            ```\n            >>> PING START\n            >>> PING END\n            >>> TRACE START\n            >>> TRACE END\n            ```\n        *   The required order inside `loopback.log` for a full run is:\n            1.  `>>> SESSION: ...`\n            2.  `>>> PING START`\n            3.  (Filtered ping output)\n            4.  `>>> PING END`\n            5.  `>>> TRACE START`\n            6.  (Traceroute output)\n            7.  `>>> TRACE END`\n\n3.  **Verification / what the grader will check**\n    *   `/home/user/netdiag/Makefile` exists.\n    *   Running \u201cmake\u201d respects `TARGET_IP`.\n    *   Rotation occurs correctly when the log file exceeds 500 bytes.\n    *   The ping output in the log does NOT contain the standard \"PING 127.0.0.1...\" header line, only the response lines.\n    *   The log file contains the session header with a valid timestamp.\n\n4.  **What you need to do**\n    *   Create the directory tree.\n    *   Author the Makefile that satisfies all rules above. (Assume `ping`, `traceroute`, `date`, `stat`, and `grep` are available.)\n    *   Run the Makefile once so that `loopback.log` is produced.\n\n5.  **IMPORTANT formatting reminder**\n    The grader is strict about the marker lines and the session header format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Ensure your `date` command produces exactly this string.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b8e6a0ea-0acd-4c20-a887-0b32e764c8d9:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
