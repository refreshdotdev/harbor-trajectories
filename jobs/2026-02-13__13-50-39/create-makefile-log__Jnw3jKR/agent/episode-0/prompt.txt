You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a network engineer who wants a repeatable way to test basic connectivity on any Linux host. 
Create a tiny automation project that lives entirely inside `/home/user/netdiag`

1.  **Directory layout that must exist at the end of the task**
    ```
    /home/user/netdiag/
    ├── Makefile
    └── logs/
        └── loopback.log   (created by running the Makefile)
        └── loopback.bak   (created only if rotation occurs)
    ```

2.  **Makefile functional requirements**

    a.  **Environment Variable Configuration**
        The target IP address MUST NOT be hardcoded. 
        The Makefile must read the target IP from an environment variable named `TARGET_IP`.
        *   If `TARGET_IP` is defined, use that value.
        *   If `TARGET_IP` is NOT defined, default to `127.0.0.1`.

    b.  **Log Rotation (Pre-flight)**
        Before running any tests, the default goal must check the size of `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log` (if it exists).
        *   If the file size is **greater than 500 bytes**, rename the existing file to `loopback.bak` (overwrite any existing .bak file), then start a fresh `loopback.log`.
        *   If the file is smaller or doesn't exist, simply append to the existing `loopback.log`.

    c.  **Default goal**
        Typing “make” (with no target) MUST execute the rotation check, write a session header, then execute the ping test, then the traceroute test.

    d.  **Individual targets**
        i.   `ping` – performs a 3-packet ping to the target IP.
             *   **Filtering**: The output MUST be filtered to ONLY show lines containing the substring "bytes from" (case-insensitive). Do not log the ping header or statistics footer.
        ii.  `trace` – performs a maximum-3-hop traceroute to the target IP.

    e.  **Logging rules**
        *   Every target MUST append its output to `/home/user/netdiag/logs/loopback.log`.
        *   **Session Header**: At the very start of the default `make` execution (after rotation but before ping), append a session line:
            ```
            >>> SESSION: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
            ```
            (Use UTC ISO 8601 format, e.g., `2024-03-15T10:00:00Z`).
        *   Each command section MUST start with an exact header line followed by the command output and a delimiter line.
            Required header / delimiter text:
            ```
            >>> PING START
            >>> PING END
            >>> TRACE START
            >>> TRACE END
            ```
        *   The required order inside `loopback.log` for a full run is:
            1.  `>>> SESSION: ...`
            2.  `>>> PING START`
            3.  (Filtered ping output)
            4.  `>>> PING END`
            5.  `>>> TRACE START`
            6.  (Traceroute output)
            7.  `>>> TRACE END`

3.  **Verification / what the grader will check**
    *   `/home/user/netdiag/Makefile` exists.
    *   Running “make” respects `TARGET_IP`.
    *   Rotation occurs correctly when the log file exceeds 500 bytes.
    *   The ping output in the log does NOT contain the standard "PING 127.0.0.1..." header line, only the response lines.
    *   The log file contains the session header with a valid timestamp.

4.  **What you need to do**
    *   Create the directory tree.
    *   Author the Makefile that satisfies all rules above. (Assume `ping`, `traceroute`, `date`, `stat`, and `grep` are available.)
    *   Run the Makefile once so that `loopback.log` is produced.

5.  **IMPORTANT formatting reminder**
    The grader is strict about the marker lines and the session header format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Ensure your `date` command produces exactly this string.
