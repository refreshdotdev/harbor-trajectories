However, the background process (PID 1186) has already exited before I could send it the SIGUSR1 signal - the shell shows \"Done\" status. This means the script completed its work or encountered an error. I need to check the exit code and output files to understand what happened.",

After that, I'll assemble the final log file by concatenating the output and error files, append the 'Process finished.' line, and remove the temporary files. Finally, I'll verify all required artifacts are in place with correct permissions.",
