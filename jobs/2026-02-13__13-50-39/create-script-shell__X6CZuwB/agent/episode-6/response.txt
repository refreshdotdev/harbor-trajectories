  "analysis": "The `SIGUSR1` signal has been sent to the process (PID 870), and I've waited for it to terminate. The process should now be finished. The next steps are to verify that the process has indeed exited, confirm its exit code was 42, and then proceed with assembling the final log file by concatenating the `.out` and `.err` files. After that, I'll append the 'Process finished.' line to the log and then remove the temporary output files.",
  "plan": "I will check if the process with PID 870 is still in the process table. If it's gone, I'll then verify its exit code by checking the status of the background job. After confirming termination, I'll concatenate `preprocess.out` and `preprocess.err` into `preprocess.log`, append the final status line, and then remove the temporary `.out` and `.err` files, leaving only the required artefacts.",
