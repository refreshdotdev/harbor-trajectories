  "analysis": "I've examined the current state and discovered that hexdump is not available in this environment. However, I was able to get the current version information and magic offset. The current version is v1.4.2 (beta) and the magic offset is 12. I also notice that version.txt doesn't appear to have a BOM since it displays cleanly. I need to calculate the new version number and prepare the artifacts.",
  "plan": "I will calculate the new version number based on the current version v1.4.2 (beta) and the magic offset of 12. The label is 'beta' which has ASCII sum of 98+101+116+97 = 412. Adding the magic offset: 412 + 12 = 424. So the new version should be 1.5.424. I'll then update version.txt and begin work on the changelog and distribution artifacts.",
