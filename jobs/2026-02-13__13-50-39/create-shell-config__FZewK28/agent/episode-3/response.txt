  "analysis": "I've successfully parsed the current version string and extracted the label 'beta'. The label length is 4 characters as expected. Now I need to calculate the ASCII sum of each character in 'beta' to determine the new PATCH number. The ASCII values are: b=98, e=101, t=116, a=97. The sum is 98+101+116+97 = 412. Adding the magic offset of 12 gives 424, so the new version will be 1.5.424.",
