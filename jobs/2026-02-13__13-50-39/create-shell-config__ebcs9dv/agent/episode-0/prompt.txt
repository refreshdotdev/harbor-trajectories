You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a Senior Release Engineer for the "Hardener" legacy security toolkit.
Your task is to prepare the Release Candidate (RC) artifacts for the next deployment cycle.

## Context

The "Hardener" project is a critical infrastructure component that is ingested by a downstream auditing system called "OldGuard" (running on Windows Server 2003). Because of this legacy dependency, the build pipeline is extremely strict about file encodings, line endings, and specific versioning entropy algorithms. Failure to adhere to these formats causes the downstream ingestion to hang.

## Workspace State

The source code lives in `/home/user/hardener`. You will find:
- `version.txt`: Contains the current version string.
- `release_notes.json`: Contains the raw changelog items for this release.
- `.config/`: A hidden configuration directory containing site-specific build variables.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: The historical change log.

## Requirements

### 1. Version Computation

You must calculate the next version number based on the current state.

**Current State:**
The `version.txt` file contains a string in the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (label)`. 
*Note: Be aware that this file was generated by a Windows tool and may contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM) which must be handled/stripped before parsing.*

**Next Version Logic:**
- **MAJOR**: Remains unchanged.
- **MINOR**: Increment the current MINOR by 1.
- **PATCH**: This is the tricky part. The "OldGuard" system requires the PATCH number to represent the "entropy" of the previous release. 
  - Calculate the **sum of the ASCII values** of every character in the `label` string (the text inside the parentheses, excluding the parentheses themselves).
  - Read the integer value from `/home/user/hardener/.config/magic_offset`.
  - **New PATCH** = (Sum of ASCII values of label) + (Value from magic_offset).

**Output:**
Overwrite `/home/user/hardener/version.txt` with the new version string.
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.5.120`).
- **Crucial Encoding Constraint**: The file must be saved with **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) encoding. 
- No trailing newline.

### 2. Changelog Generation

You must prepend a new entry to `/home/user/hardener/CHANGELOG.md`.

**Source:**
Read items from `release_notes.json`. Note that the JSON keys (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`) may be capitalized differently than the output headers.

**Sorting Rule:**
To ensure readability on the legacy 80-column displays, items within each section must be sorted by **string length in descending order** (longest items first). If two items have the same length, sort them alphabetically.

**Formatting:**
The output format for the new section is strict:

```markdown
## Version <NEW_VERSION> :: <YYYY.MM.DD>
### Added
- <Item>

### Changed
- <Item>

### Fixed
- <Item>
```

(Use `_None_` if a list is empty).

**Line Endings:**
Because the file is viewed on Windows, the **entire** `CHANGELOG.md` file (both the new section and the existing content) must be converted to use **CRLF** (\r\n) line endings. 

### 3. Distribution Manifest

Create a directory `/home/user/hardener/dist` and generate a checksum map named `release.map`.

**Content:**
This file must list the **SHA256** checksums of the following files:
1. `version.txt`
2. `CHANGELOG.md`

**Format:**
`<SHA256_HASH>  <FILENAME_UPPERCASE>`

The downstream parser requires the filenames in the map to be fully **UPPERCASE** (e.g., `VERSION.TXT`), even though the actual files on disk are lowercase. The paths must be relative to the hardener root.

### 4. Audit Logging

Create a log file at `/home/user/hardener/bump.log`.

- The **first line** of the log must be: `START_HASH: <SHA256 hash of the ORIGINAL version.txt file>`.
- The **body** of the log must contain every shell command executed.
- The **last line** of the log must be: `END_HASH: <SHA256 hash of the NEW version.txt file>`.

## Summary of Deliverables

1. `version.txt`: Updated, ISO-8859-1 encoded, no newline.
2. `CHANGELOG.md`: Prepended, sorted by length, CRLF line endings.
3. `dist/release.map`: SHA256 sums, uppercase filenames.
4. `bump.log`: Command log with start/end hashes.

Failure to handle the BOM, the ASCII entropy calculation, or the CRLF conversion will result in a rejected build.
