            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Incident Response Task: SSH Brute Force Analysis\n\n**To:** Junior Analyst\n**From:** Lead Investigator\n**Subject:** URGENT: Parse these logs for the Q3 audit\n\nWe have seized some server logs from a compromised machine. I've dumped everything into `/home/user/evidence/`. There might be some old rotated logs in subdirectories there too. \n\nI need you to generate a clean CSV report of the attackers. The legal team is very specific about the format this time because they're feeding it into a legacy mainframe.\n\n### Phase 1: Sanitation\nFirst, the logs are a mess. Some corrupted binary data got mixed in. You need to create a single consolidated log file at `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`. This file must contain the text content of **all** the evidence logs (both plain text and compressed `.gz` files), but you **must** strip out any lines containing null bytes (`\\x00`) or other non-printable control characters (ASCII 0-31), except for newlines and tabs. Ensure the final file is strictly UTF-8, replacing any invalid byte sequences from the source files with a replacement character ().\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis\nRead your cleaned log file. We are looking for \"Failed password\" events. \n\nHowever, we only care about attacks on high ports. The specific port threshold is defined in the configuration file located at `/home/user/.config/ir_settings.ini` under the `[Filters]` section. **Do not hardcode the port number**; read it from the config.\n\n### Phase 3: The Report\nGenerate a report at `/home/user/out/report.csv`.\n\n**Data Format Requirements (Read Carefully):**\n1. **Time Normalization**: The logs are in the server's local time (EST, which is UTC-5). The report must list timestamps in **UTC** ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Assume the year is **2023** for all entries.\n2. **Columns**: The columns are `IP`, `First_Seen_UTC`, and `Attempt_Count`.\n   - `First_Seen_UTC` is the timestamp of the *earliest* valid attack found for that IP.\n3. **Delimiters**: This is the weird part. The **header row** must use **commas** (`,`) as the delimiter. The **data rows** must use **semicolons** (`;`) as the delimiter. (Don't ask, it's for the legacy importer).\n4. **Sorting**: Sort the list by `Attempt_Count` (descending). If the counts are equal, break ties by `First_Seen_UTC` (descending / most recent first).\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\nFinally, to ensure integrity, generate a SHA-1 checksum of your final `report.csv` and save it to `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`. The file should contain only the hex hash, no filenames.\n\n**Summary of Deliverables:**\n- `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`\n\nGood luck.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e1f59613-b6d2-4259-a1f4-9cbc37a4ad3d:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Incident Response Task: SSH Brute Force Analysis\n\n**To:** Junior Analyst\n**From:** Lead Investigator\n**Subject:** URGENT: Parse these logs for the Q3 audit\n\nWe have seized some server logs from a compromised machine. I've dumped everything into `/home/user/evidence/`. There might be some old rotated logs in subdirectories there too. \n\nI need you to generate a clean CSV report of the attackers. The legal team is very specific about the format this time because they're feeding it into a legacy mainframe.\n\n### Phase 1: Sanitation\nFirst, the logs are a mess. Some corrupted binary data got mixed in. You need to create a single consolidated log file at `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`. This file must contain the text content of **all** the evidence logs (both plain text and compressed `.gz` files), but you **must** strip out any lines containing null bytes (`\\x00`) or other non-printable control characters (ASCII 0-31), except for newlines and tabs. Ensure the final file is strictly UTF-8, replacing any invalid byte sequences from the source files with a replacement character ().\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis\nRead your cleaned log file. We are looking for \"Failed password\" events. \n\nHowever, we only care about attacks on high ports. The specific port threshold is defined in the configuration file located at `/home/user/.config/ir_settings.ini` under the `[Filters]` section. **Do not hardcode the port number**; read it from the config.\n\n### Phase 3: The Report\nGenerate a report at `/home/user/out/report.csv`.\n\n**Data Format Requirements (Read Carefully):**\n1. **Time Normalization**: The logs are in the server's local time (EST, which is UTC-5). The report must list timestamps in **UTC** ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Assume the year is **2023** for all entries.\n2. **Columns**: The columns are `IP`, `First_Seen_UTC`, and `Attempt_Count`.\n   - `First_Seen_UTC` is the timestamp of the *earliest* valid attack found for that IP.\n3. **Delimiters**: This is the weird part. The **header row** must use **commas** (`,`) as the delimiter. The **data rows** must use **semicolons** (`;`) as the delimiter. (Don't ask, it's for the legacy importer).\n4. **Sorting**: Sort the list by `Attempt_Count` (descending). If the counts are equal, break ties by `First_Seen_UTC` (descending / most recent first).\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\nFinally, to ensure integrity, generate a SHA-1 checksum of your final `report.csv` and save it to `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`. The file should contain only the hex hash, no filenames.\n\n**Summary of Deliverables:**\n- `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`\n\nGood luck.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e1f59613-b6d2-4259-a1f4-9cbc37a4ad3d:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Incident Response Task: SSH Brute Force Analysis\n\n**To:** Junior Analyst\n**From:** Lead Investigator\n**Subject:** URGENT: Parse these logs for the Q3 audit\n\nWe have seized some server logs from a compromised machine. I've dumped everything into `/home/user/evidence/`. There might be some old rotated logs in subdirectories there too. \n\nI need you to generate a clean CSV report of the attackers. The legal team is very specific about the format this time because they're feeding it into a legacy mainframe.\n\n### Phase 1: Sanitation\nFirst, the logs are a mess. Some corrupted binary data got mixed in. You need to create a single consolidated log file at `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`. This file must contain the text content of **all** the evidence logs (both plain text and compressed `.gz` files), but you **must** strip out any lines containing null bytes (`\\x00`) or other non-printable control characters (ASCII 0-31), except for newlines and tabs. Ensure the final file is strictly UTF-8, replacing any invalid byte sequences from the source files with a replacement character ().\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis\nRead your cleaned log file. We are looking for \"Failed password\" events. \n\nHowever, we only care about attacks on high ports. The specific port threshold is defined in the configuration file located at `/home/user/.config/ir_settings.ini` under the `[Filters]` section. **Do not hardcode the port number**; read it from the config.\n\n### Phase 3: The Report\nGenerate a report at `/home/user/out/report.csv`.\n\n**Data Format Requirements (Read Carefully):**\n1. **Time Normalization**: The logs are in the server's local time (EST, which is UTC-5). The report must list timestamps in **UTC** ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Assume the year is **2023** for all entries.\n2. **Columns**: The columns are `IP`, `First_Seen_UTC`, and `Attempt_Count`.\n   - `First_Seen_UTC` is the timestamp of the *earliest* valid attack found for that IP.\n3. **Delimiters**: This is the weird part. The **header row** must use **commas** (`,`) as the delimiter. The **data rows** must use **semicolons** (`;`) as the delimiter. (Don't ask, it's for the legacy importer).\n4. **Sorting**: Sort the list by `Attempt_Count` (descending). If the counts are equal, break ties by `First_Seen_UTC` (descending / most recent first).\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\nFinally, to ensure integrity, generate a SHA-1 checksum of your final `report.csv` and save it to `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`. The file should contain only the hex hash, no filenames.\n\n**Summary of Deliverables:**\n- `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`\n\nGood luck.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e1f59613-b6d2-4259-a1f4-9cbc37a4ad3d:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
