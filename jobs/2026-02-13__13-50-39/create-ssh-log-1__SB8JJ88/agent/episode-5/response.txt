The processing script is designed to handle sanitization by removing null bytes and control characters while preserving printable ASCII characters, tabs, and newlines.",
  "plan": "Next, I'll test the log processing script with my sample files. Since the actual evidence directory is empty, I'll copy my sample files into it and then run the processing script. After verifying the cleaned log output, I'll proceed to extract the failed password attempts, filter by the high port threshold (45000), and begin building the final report with the required formatting.",
