      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a build-and-release engineer who has just cloned a tiny demo project located in\n    /home/user/artifact-project (the directory exists and contains a VERSION file).\n\n    Your goal is to author a GNU Makefile that automates a complete build / test / package\n    workflow. You must implement dynamic versioning, parallel compilation of intermediate objects,\n    and checksum verification.\n\n    Final deliverables that MUST exist **after you run \u201cmake all\u201d**:\n\n    1. /home/user/artifact-project/build/mytool\n       \u2022 regular text file\n       \u2022 contents:\n         `int main(){`\n         `return 0;}`\n         (The file should consist of these two lines, resulting from the concatenation of part_a and part_b)\n\n    2. /home/user/artifact-project/reports/test-results.log\n       \u2022 regular text file\n       \u2022 exact contents (two lines):\n         Line 1: `TEST_SUITE_RESULT: PASS`\n         Line 2: `TEST_USER: <username>`\n         (Where `<username>` is the output of the `whoami` command executed at runtime)\n\n    3. /home/user/artifact-project/dist/mytool-<VERSION>.tar.gz\n       \u2022 gzip-compressed tar archive\n       \u2022 The `<VERSION>` string must be read from the file `/home/user/artifact-project/VERSION`.\n         You must strip all whitespace (newlines, spaces) from the content of the VERSION file\n         to determine the version string.\n       \u2022 The archive must contain exactly these two members in this order:\n         a) build/mytool\n         b) reports/test-results.log\n       \u2022 Intermediate files (part_a, part_b) must NOT be in the archive.\n\n    4. /home/user/artifact-project/dist/mytool-<VERSION>.tar.gz.sha256\n       \u2022 A text file containing the SHA256 checksum of the generated tarball.\n       \u2022 It must contain the standard output of `sha256sum` run on the tarball file.\n\n    5. The Makefile itself, stored at /home/user/artifact-project/Makefile, must define at\n       least the following phony targets:\n\n       \u2022 compile   \u2013 produces build/mytool, build/part_a, and build/part_b\n         - *Must* launch and synchronize at least two commands that run in parallel:\n           1. Create `build/part_a` containing `int main(){`, print \"Building part A\", sleep 1.\n           2. Create `build/part_b` containing `return 0;}`, print \"Building part B\", sleep 1.\n         - Use `&` and `wait` to manage concurrency within the recipe.\n         - After synchronization, concatenate `part_a` and `part_b` to create `build/mytool`.\n\n       \u2022 test      \u2013 generates reports/test-results.log with the two lines specified above.\n\n       \u2022 package   \u2013 creates dist/, reads the VERSION file, creates the named tarball,\n                     and generates the .sha256 checksum file.\n\n       \u2022 clean     \u2013 removes build/, reports/, and dist/.\n\n       \u2022 all       \u2013 default target that depends on compile, test and package\n                     in that order.\n\n    6. The Makefile must also declare `.PHONY: all compile test package clean`.\n\n    Operating constraints & tips:\n\n    \u2022 You have standard GNU coreutils and GNU Make on the system.\n    \u2022 Do not hard-code the version \"1.5.0\" in the Makefile; read it from the VERSION file.\n    \u2022 Do not hard-code the username; use `whoami`.\n    \u2022 Ensure all intermediate directories (build/, reports/, dist/) are created automatically.\n    \u2022 File and directory names are *case-sensitive*.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0de6b15d-d1e5-44b5-aafd-9a58246a37f5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
