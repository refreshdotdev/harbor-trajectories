The task requires me to back up a specific directory, create a manifest, and generate a summary file with specific encoding and content requirements. The directory to back up is `/home/user/tickets/issue_20230815/`, and the output files need to go into `/home/user/backups/`. I need to check if the source directory and backup directory exist, and if not, create them. The legacy system has strict requirements for handling symlinks and file exclusions.",

Create the gzip-compressed tarball with dereferenced symlinks, excluding broken symlinks and patterns from `.backupignore`. 4. Generate the JSON manifest with archive metadata. 5. Generate the legacy summary text file with ISO-8859-1 encoding and CRLF line endings.",
