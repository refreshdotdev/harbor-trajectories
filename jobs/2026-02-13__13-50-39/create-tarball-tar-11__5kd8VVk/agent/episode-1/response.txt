The backup directory `/home/user/backups` also exists. I'm currently in the `/home/user/tickets` directory. Next I need to create the tarball while handling symlinks and exclusions properly.",
  "plan": "1. Read and parse the `.backupignore` file from the source directory, filtering out comments. 2. Create the tarball using tar with gzip compression, ensuring symlinks are dereferenced, broken symlinks are skipped, and excluded patterns are respected. 3. Use Python to generate the JSON manifest with the required metadata about the created tarball.",
