This pipeline feeds data into an old Windows Server 2003 system that has strict, archaic requirements regarding file formats and character encodings.\n\nYour task is to package a support ticket directory into a specific backup format, generate metadata, and create a summary file compatible with the legacy ingestion service.\n\n## Source Directory\n\nThe directory to back up is located at:\n`/home/user/tickets/issue_20230815/`\n\nIt contains user notes, logs, and various temporary files. It also contains a `.backupignore` file which dictates local exclusion rules.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. The Archive\nYou must create a gzip-compressed tarball of the directory.\n\n*   **Output Path**: `/home/user/backups/support_issue_20230815_legacy.tar.gz`\n*   **Dereferencing**: The source directory contains symbolic links. The backup must contain the **actual content** of the linked files (dereference symlinks), not the links themselves.\n*   **Safety & Sanitation**: The source directory is known to contain \"broken\" symlinks (pointing to non-existent files) and potentially recursive symlink loops. The legacy unpacker crashes if it encounters these. You must **detect and exclude** any broken symlinks or recursive loops from the archive. The backup process must not fail due to these files.\n*   **Exclusions**: You must parse the `.backupignore` file found in the source root. Any files matching the glob patterns listed in that file must be excluded from the archive. (Note: The ignore file may contain comments starting with `#`).\n\n### 2. The Manifest\nOnce the archive is created, generate a JSON manifest at `/home/user/backups/backup_manifest.json` containing metadata about the archive.\n\nThe JSON object must contain exactly these keys:\n*   `archive_name`: The filename of the tarball.\n*   `file_size_bytes`: Integer size of the tarball.\n*   `md5_hash`: MD5 hash of the tarball (hex string).\n*   `sha256_hash`: SHA-256 hash of the tarball (hex string).\n*   `created_at_utc`: The current timestamp in ISO 8601 format (UTC), e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`.\n\n### 3. The Legacy Summary Report\nFinally, you must generate a summary text file at `/home/user/backups/backup_summary.txt`. This file is consumed by a legacy Windows parser and has **strict encoding rules**:\n\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings**: The file must use Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n*   **Content**: The file must contain exactly two lines:\n    1.  `Legacy Backup Operation \u00a9 2023`\n    2.  `Manifest SHA256: <SHA256 hash of the manifest file>`\n\n    *(Note: The copyright symbol '\u00a9' is mandatory and serves as an encoding check for the legacy parser. The second line contains the hash of the JSON manifest you created in step 2, creating a chain of custody.)*\n\n## Constraints\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python 3 is recommended for the logic and encoding requirements).\n*   Do not use `sudo`.\n*   Ensure the final exit code is 0.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@deb58943-740c-4aba-bfc4-495080ea5672:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

No prior work has been done, so all steps need to be executed from scratch.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"First, I will navigate to the home directory and check if the target backup and source ticket directories exist. Then, I will create a Python script to handle the complex backup logic: parsing the .backupignore file, safely creating a tarball while dereferencing symlinks, excluding broken symlinks and recursive loops, and applying glob ignore patterns. After creating the tarball, the script will generate the JSON manifest with required metadata including file size, MD5 hash, SHA256 hash, and a UTC timestamp. Finally, the script will create the legacy summary text file with the correct ISO-8859-1 encoding and Windows-style CRLF line endings.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd /home/user\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"ls -la\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > backup_tool.py << 'EOF'\\\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nLegacy System Backup Tool\\\\nCreates a gzip-compressed tarball of a directory with safety measures,\\\\ngenerates a JSON manifest, and creates a legacy summary file.\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\nimport os\\\\nimport sys\\\\nimport tarfile\\\\nimport json\\\\nimport hashlib\\\\nimport datetime\\\\nimport glob\\\\nimport io\\\\nimport shutil\\\\n\\\\n# Configuration\\\\nSOURCE_DIR = \\\\\\\"/home/user/tickets/issue_20230815/\\\\\\\"\\\\nTAR_OUTPUT_PATH = \\\\\\\"/home/user/backups/support_issue_20230815_legacy.tar.gz\\\\\\\"\\\\nMANIFEST_OUTPUT_PATH = \\\\\\\"/home/user/backups/backup_manifest.json\\\\\\\"\\\\nSUMMARY_OUTPUT_PATH = \\\\\\\"/home/user/backups/backup_summary.txt\\\\\\\"\\\\nIGNORE_FILENAME = \\\\\\\".backupignore\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\ndef read_ignore_file(directory):\\\\n    \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Read and parse the .backupignore file.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    ignore_patterns = []\\\\n    ignore_file_path = os.path.join(directory, IGNORE_FILENAME)\\\\n    try:\\\\n        with open(ignore_file_path, 'r') as f:\\\\n            for line in f:\\\\n                line = line.strip()\\\\n                if line and not line.startswith('#'):\\\\n                    ignore_patterns.append(line)\\\\n    except FileNotFoundError:\\\\n        pass  #
