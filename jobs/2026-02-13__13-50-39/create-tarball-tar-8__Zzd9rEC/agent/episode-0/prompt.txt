You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are the lead integration engineer for a legacy data migration project. Your team has received a bundle of application logs that must be pre-processed before being fed into an old IBM mainframe system (`System-Z`).

Your task is to write a bash script that extracts specific error logs, redacts sensitive information based on dynamic configuration, and generates a summary report formatted strictly for the mainframe's ingestion interface.

### Input Data

1.  **Log Archive**: Located at `/home/user/datasets/log_archive.tar.gz`.
    *   This archive contains a directory tree of log files.
    *   **Filtering Rule**: You must process **ONLY** the files whose filenames start with `prod-` (e.g., `prod-api.log`). Ignore `dev-`, `test-`, or any other prefixes. Ignore any files not in the top-level `logs/` directory of the archive.
    *   **Log Format**: Each line is UTF-8 text: `YYYY-MM-DD␉HH:MM:SS␉LEVEL␉MODULE␉MESSAGE` (tab-separated).

2.  **Configuration**: Located at `/home/user/config/settings.json`.
    *   This JSON file contains critical parameters for your processing logic, including the redaction placeholder and the required output encoding.

### Output Artifacts

All outputs must be placed in `/home/user/clean_data/` (create if missing).

#### 1. The Mainframe Log (`/home/user/clean_data/mainframe_errors.log`)

*   **Content**: Include only lines where LEVEL is `ERROR` and MODULE is `DataCleaner`.
*   **Redaction**: The MESSAGE field contains email addresses. You must replace ALL email addresses with the **exact string value** found in the `redaction_label` key of `settings.json`. 
    *   *Note*: Do not hardcode the label (e.g., "<REDACTED>"). Read it from the JSON file at runtime. Use a standard email regex (alphanumeric+symbols @ alphanumeric+symbols . alpha).
*   **Sorting**: Sort the lines chronologically (ascending).
*   **Encoding**: The file must be standard **UTF-8** with Unix line endings (`\n`).

#### 2. The Daily Summary (`/home/user/clean_data/daily_summary.csv`)

This file is ingested by a COBOL parser and is extremely brittle.

*   **Format**: Comma-separated values (CSV).
*   **Header**: `Date,Error_Count,Earliest_Error`
*   **Data Rows**: Aggregated by date.
    *   `Date`: Must be formatted as `DD-MMM-YYYY` in **UPPERCASE** (e.g., `01-JUL-2023`).
    *   `Error_Count`: Total number of DataCleaner errors for that date.
    *   `Earliest_Error`: The timestamp (`HH:MM:SS`) of the first error encountered on that date.
*   **Encoding & Line Endings**: 
    *   The file must be encoded according to the `target_encoding` key in `settings.json` (e.g., ISO-8859-1).
    *   The file must end with Windows-style CRLF line endings (`\r\n`), including the last line.

#### 3. Verification Checksum (`/home/user/clean_data/checksum.md5`)

*   Compute the MD5 checksum of the final `mainframe_errors.log` file.
*   The file content should consist of the hash, followed by two spaces, followed by the filename `mainframe_errors.log`.

### Constraints

*   **Tooling**: Use standard Linux shell utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `sort`, `jq`, `iconv`, `md5sum`, `date`, etc.). Do not use high-level scripting languages like Python, Ruby, or Perl for the main logic.
*   **Precision**: The automated grader verifies binary exactness for the CSV encoding and line endings. Pay attention to the `settings.json` values.

### Completion Criteria

1.  `mainframe_errors.log` exists, includes only `prod-` logs, is filtered/redacted/sorted correctly, and matches the MD5 in the checksum file.
2.  `daily_summary.csv` exists, uses the correct date format (UPPERCASE), correct encoding (from JSON), and CRLF line endings.
3.  Redaction uses the specific label defined in the config file.
