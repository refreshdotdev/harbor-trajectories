A log entry for this archive operation has been added to `/home/user/hardening_summary.log`. The next step is to harden the copied baseline files by appending filtered directives from the policy files.",
  "plan": "I will first create copies of the baseline files to serve as the base for the hardened versions (`sshd_config_hardened` and `sysctl_hardened.conf`). Then, I will process the respective policy files (`ssh_policy.txt` and `sysctl_policy.txt`) to filter out all comment lines (starting with `#`) and empty lines. These filtered active directives will be appended to the newly created copies of the baseline files. Finally, I will set the permissions of these hardened files to 0600 and log these hardening operations.",
