  "analysis": "All specified operations have been successfully executed. The secure working directory `/home/user/hardening_workshop` was created with 0700 permissions. The two baseline configuration files were copied into this directory with 0600 permissions. A backup archive named according to the specified format (including the current UTC date and ISO week number) was created and given 0600 permissions. The SSH and sysctl policy files were parsed to remove comments and blank lines, and their active directives were appended to create the hardened configuration files, which also received 0600 permissions. Finally, a `/home/user/hardening_summary.log` file was created and populated with chronological entries for each operation that resulted in a new on-disk object, including UTC timestamps, action tags, source/destination paths, and SHA256 checksums.",
