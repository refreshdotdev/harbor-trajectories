You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a Linux systems-engineer participating in a strict hardening workshop.
Your job is to secure two baseline configuration files by archiving them and then applying specific security policies.

**Task Requirements:**

1.  **Create a Secure Working Directory**
    *   Create a directory: `/home/user/hardening_workshop`
    *   **Constraint**: This directory must have strict permissions: **0700** (rwx------).

2.  **Copy Baseline Files**
    *   Copy the *exact* two baseline files listed below into `/home/user/hardening_workshop`, keeping their original filenames:
        *   `/home/user/baseline_configs/ssh/sshd_config_baseline`
        *   `/home/user/baseline_configs/sysctl/sysctl_baseline.conf`
    *   **Constraint**: The copies must have strict permissions: **0600** (rw-------).

3.  **Create a Backup Archive**
    *   Inside `/home/user/hardening_workshop`, create **one** backup archive (a single, compressed **tar.gz**) containing *only* the two copied baseline files.
    *   **Naming Convention**: `baseline_backup_YYYYMMDD_Www.tar.gz`
        *   `YYYYMMDD`: Today’s date in UTC.
        *   `Www`: The ISO-8601 week number (01-53) of today’s date (e.g., `W05`, `W42`).
    *   **Constraint**: The archive file itself must have strict permissions: **0600**.

4.  **Harden the Files via Policy**
    *   You are provided with two raw policy files containing comments and blank lines:
        *   `/home/user/security_policies/ssh_policy.txt`
        *   `/home/user/security_policies/sysctl_policy.txt`
    *   **Action**:
        a.  Create `sshd_config_hardened`: A copy of `sshd_config_baseline` with the valid directives from `ssh_policy.txt` appended.
        b.  Create `sysctl_hardened.conf`: A copy of `sysctl_baseline.conf` with the valid directives from `sysctl_policy.txt` appended.
    *   **Parsing Rules**: You must **filter out** all empty lines and lines starting with `#` (comments) from the policy files before appending. Only active configuration lines should be appended.
    *   **Constraint**: The hardened files must have strict permissions: **0600**.

5.  **Generate a Verified Summary Log**
    *   Create a log file: `/home/user/hardening_summary.log`
    *   Log every operation that results in a new on-disk object (Directory, Copy, Archive, Hardened File).
    *   **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC | ACTION=<tag> | SRC=<path> | DST=<path> | HASH=<sha256> | STATUS=OK`
    *   **Fields**:
        *   `<tag>`: MKDIR, COPY, ARCHIVE, HARDEN
        *   `SRC`: Absolute source path. Use `-` (hyphen) for MKDIR and ARCHIVE.
        *   `DST`: Absolute destination path.
        *   `HASH`: The **SHA256 checksum** of the object at `DST`. Use `-` (hyphen) for MKDIR. For files/archives, it must be the full lowercase hex digest.
    *   **Constraint**: Lines must be chronological. Use UTC time.

**Automated Checker Validation:**
*   Existence and permissions (0700 for dir, 0600 for files) of all artefacts.
*   Correct naming of the tarball including the ISO week number.
*   Correct filtering of policy files (no comments/blanks in hardened files).
*   Log file format, including the correct SHA256 hashes of the created files.

**Important:**
*   Do not modify the original files in `baseline_configs` or `security_policies`.
*   Timestamps and dates must be UTC.
*   Only the `hardening_summary.log` is graded for the logging requirement.
