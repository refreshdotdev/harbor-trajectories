After that, I will process `ssh_policy.txt` from `/home/user/security_policies/ssh_policy.txt`. I will filter out empty lines and lines starting with `#`, then append the remaining active directives to a copy of `sshd_config_baseline` to create `sshd_config_hardened`. This new file will also have its permissions set to 0600 and will be logged.",
