Similar to the SSH hardening, its SHA256 checksum (e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855) indicates it is an empty file. This suggests that `sysctl_policy.txt` also contained only comments and empty lines after processing, or the source `sysctl_baseline.conf` was empty. All file operations (directory creation, file copies, archive creation, file hardening) are now complete. The final step is to generate the summary log file.",
  "plan": "I will use `date` to get the current UTC timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. Then, I will create the log file `/home/user/hardening_summary.log`. I will append log entries for each operation that created a new on-disk object: MKDIR (for the directory), COPY (for the two baseline files), ARCHIVE (for the tarball), and HARDEN (for the two hardened files). Each log entry will include the UTC timestamp, action tag, source path, destination path, and the SHA256 checksum of the created object (or '-' for the directory).",
