The source directory '/home/user/data' exists and contains two subdirectories: 'projects' and 'reports'. Neither the backup destination directory nor the log file currently exist, so they need to be created.",
  "plan": "I will now create the backup destination directory and the log file's parent directory if they don't exist. Then, I will implement the backup rotation logic by checking if any existing archives or checksum files exist in the backup destination. Finally, I will generate the archive name using the current date and prepare the commands for creating the tar.gz archive with the required filtering and normalization.",
