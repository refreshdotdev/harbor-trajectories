The script contains all the required functionality: it reads environment variables with defaults, creates necessary directories, handles rotation by renaming existing files, creates a compressed tar.gz archive with proper filtering (excluding .tmp files and broken symlinks) and normalization (setting ownership to root:root and removing others' permissions), generates a SHA-256 checksum file, and logs the operation with the required header format.",
  "plan": "I will now execute the backup script and verify its execution by checking the contents of the backup destination directory and the log file. This will confirm that the archive was created correctly, the checksum file is valid, and the log file contains the appropriate header and log entry.",
