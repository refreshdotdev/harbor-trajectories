You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are assisting a junior backup-administrator who must implement a robust archive routine with specific compliance, filtering, and configuration requirements.

Starting point
--------------
1. The filesystem contains a data directory `/home/user/data` with various project files and reports.
2. The environment defines two variables (already set in the container):
   • `BACKUP_DEST`: The directory where archives and checksums must be stored.
   • `LOG_FILE`: The full path to the log file.

Mission
-------
1. **Configuration & Setup**
   • Your script must read the destination directory from the `BACKUP_DEST` environment variable. (If unset, default to `/home/user/archives`).
   • Your script must read the log file path from the `LOG_FILE` environment variable. (If unset, default to `/home/user/backup_logs/backup.log`).
   • Ensure these directories exist before writing to them.

2. **Archive Creation with Filtering & Normalization**
   • Create a compressed **tar.gz** archive of the contents of `/home/user/data/`.
   • **Exclusions**: You must EXCLUDE any files ending in `.tmp` and any symbolic links that are broken (point to non-existent targets).
   • **Normalization**: Inside the archive, to satisfy compliance rules:
     - All entries (files and directories) must be owned by **root** (UID 0) and group **root** (GID 0).
     - All entries must have **NO permissions for 'others'** (e.g., `chmod o-rwx`). Standard permissions for owner/group are fine (e.g., 0640 or 0750).
   • The archive name must be: `daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` (stored in `BACKUP_DEST`).

3. **Checksum**
   • Produce a SHA-256 checksum file in `BACKUP_DEST` named `daily_YYYYMMDD.sha256`.
   • Content format: `SHA256 (daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz) = <64-hex-digit-digest>`

4. **Logging with Header**
   • Append a line to `LOG_FILE`.
   • **Header Requirement**: If the log file is being created for the first time (it does not exist yet), the **first line** of the file must be exactly:
     `TIMESTAMP | ARCHIVE | STATUS`
   • The log entry for the run must follow this format:
     `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz - OK`

5. **Rotation**
   • If the archive or checksum file already exists in `BACKUP_DEST`, rename the existing one to append `.bak-UNIXTIMESTAMP` before creating the new one.

Expected final state
--------------------
1. The `daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` exists in the configured `BACKUP_DEST`.
2. The archive contains all files from `/home/user/data` EXCEPT `.tmp` files and broken symlinks. Directory entries should not be explicitly included as members, only the files themselves.
3. The archive members have UID 0, GID 0, and no permissions for 'others'.
4. The checksum file exists and is valid.
5. The `LOG_FILE` exists, starts with the header (if it was new), and contains the success log line.
