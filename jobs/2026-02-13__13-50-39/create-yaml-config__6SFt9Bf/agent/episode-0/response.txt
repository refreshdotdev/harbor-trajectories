  "analysis": "The current terminal state shows a clean shell with no prior commands executed. The user is root in a container-like environment. The task requires several steps: synchronizing files from a source to a destination directory with specific exceptions, performing string interpolation in a configuration file, setting precise permissions on Python scripts and a YAML file, generating a manifest of file checksums, and creating a deployment log. All necessary paths are provided and must be used as specified.",
  "plan": "I will begin by navigating to the source directory and examining its contents. Then I will move to the destination directory and perform a dry-run of the rsync command to preview changes. After verifying the dry-run, I will execute the actual rsync command with the necessary exclusion patterns and deletion options. Following the synchronisation, I will read the device serial number from /etc/iot_serial, trim any whitespace, and use it to replace the placeholder in the destination's config.yaml file. Next, I will set appropriate permissions on Python files (755) and the config.yaml file (400). After that, I will generate a manifest file containing SHA-256 checksums of all files in the destination (excluding the manifest itself), sorted alphabetically with the required formatting. Finally, I will create the deployment log directory and file with the specified content and ensure all conditions are met before declaring the task complete.",
