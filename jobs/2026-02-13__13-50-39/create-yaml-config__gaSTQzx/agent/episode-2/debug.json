Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are an edge-computing engineer deploying updated code to a fleet of IoT devices.\n    In this sandbox one device is represented by the local directory  \n    /home/user/iot_device/edge_app/  \n\n    A freshly-built release is waiting in  \n    /home/user/edge_source/  \n\n    Your goal is to **synchronise** the two trees and apply device-specific configurations.\n\n    **Requirements:**\n\n    1. **Synchronisation**:\n       Synchronise `/home/user/edge_source/` to `/home/user/iot_device/edge_app/`.\n       - Copy new or modified files.\n       - Remove any files in the destination that do not exist in the source.\n       - **EXCEPTION**: Do **not** copy any files ending in `.log` or `.tmp` from the source. These are build artifacts and must not exist on the device.\n\n    2. **Configuration Interpolation**:\n       The source `config.yaml` contains the placeholder `{{SERIAL_NUMBER}}`.\n       - You must replace this string in the destination file with the actual device serial number found in `/etc/iot_serial`.\n       - Ensure you trim any surrounding whitespace from the serial number source.\n       - The final `config.yaml` in the destination must contain `setting: prod` and the correct `serial: ...` line.\n\n    3. **Permissions & Security**:\n       - All Python scripts (`.py`) in the destination must be executable by everyone (mode `755` / `rwxr-xr-x`).\n       - The `config.yaml` file in the destination contains secrets; it must be read-only for the owner and inaccessible to others (mode `400` / `r--------`).\n\n    4. **Manifest Generation**:\n       - Create a file `/home/user/iot_device/edge_app/manifest.txt`.\n       - This file must contain the SHA-256 checksums of all files in the destination directory (excluding `manifest.txt` itself).\n       - Format: `HASH  filename` (two spaces between hash and filename), one per line.\n       - The list must be sorted alphabetically by filename.\n\n    5. **Logging**:\n       - Create the directory `/home/user/deployment_logs/` (if missing).\n       - Create `/home/user/deployment_logs/sync_2024.log` with **exactly** these three lines (terminated by UNIX newlines):\n         ```text\n         SYNC COMPLETE\n         SOURCE: /home/user/edge_source/\n         DESTINATION: /home/user/iot_device/edge_app/\n         ```\n\n    **Notes & Constraints**:\n    - Do not modify the paths shown above.\n    - You do *not* have SSH access; treat the \u201cremote\u201d device as the local directory given.\n    - Do not run commands with sudo. Everything must be achievable as the normal user.\n    - When you are finished, the grader will verify all conditions exactly.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@de69c9a6-1e82-4763-b927-7f907d5ccc40:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
