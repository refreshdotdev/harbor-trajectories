The first step is to navigate to the `/home/user` directory to address the `api-test` path. The existing `api-test` path needs to be sanitized (if it's a symlink or corrupted file, it must be removed; if it's a directory, its contents must be removed). After this, we'll create a clean directory and proceed with the subsequent steps of the task.",
