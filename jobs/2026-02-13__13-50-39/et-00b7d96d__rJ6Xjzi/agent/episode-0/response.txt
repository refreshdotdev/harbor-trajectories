  "analysis": "I've been tasked with setting up a Python-based integration testbed for a legacy system, including environment sanitization, package version resolution from tiered configurations, virtual environment creation with a critical patch, and generation of specific audit artifacts. The current terminal state shows me as root in my home directory (`/root`). My first step is to navigate to the target project directory `/home/user/api-test` to assess its current state and begin the cleanup process.",
  "plan": "1. Navigate to the `/home/user/api-test` directory. 2. Investigate the current state of the directory (whether it's a symlink, corrupted file, or existing directory). 3. Remove any existing content or problematic structure at that path to ensure a clean, real directory. 4. Create the `api-test` directory if it doesn't exist as a proper directory. This will set up a clean environment for the testbed.",
