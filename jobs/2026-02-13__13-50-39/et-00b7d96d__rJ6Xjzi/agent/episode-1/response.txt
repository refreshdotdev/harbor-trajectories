This means it's already a clean directory, so the sanitization step (ensuring it's a real directory and removing previous content) is effectively complete. I can now proceed to set up the virtual environment and resolve package versions.",
  "plan": "1. Create a Python virtual environment named `env` inside the `/home/user/api-test` directory. 2. Activate the virtual environment. 3. Install Python's `hashlib` module, as it's required for generating SHA256 hashes needed for the `inventory.json` artifact. 4. Download the `httpx` and `requests` packages in `.whl` format using pip, but without installing them yet. This will allow me to extract their version information for use in `requirements.txt` and `install.log` without committing to specific versions before resolving them from the configuration files.",
