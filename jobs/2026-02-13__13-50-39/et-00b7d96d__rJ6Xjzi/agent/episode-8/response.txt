I need to wait for the pip install to finish definitively. The `sleep 10` command should give it enough time. After that, the variable assignments and checks should work.",
  "plan": "1. Wait for the `pip install` command to fully complete (the sleep should handle this). 2. Verify that `httpx` and `requests` versions were correctly captured into shell variables (`httpx_ver`, `requests_ver`). If they are empty, it means the `pip show` commands ran before installation was complete; in that case, I'll re-run `pip show` to get the versions. 3. Confirm that the `env/bin/activate` script was successfully patched with `export PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1`. 4. Proceed to generate all three required audit artifacts.",
