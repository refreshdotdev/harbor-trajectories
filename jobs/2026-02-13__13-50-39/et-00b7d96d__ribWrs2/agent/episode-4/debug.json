Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Legacy Integration Testbed Setup\n\nYou are tasked with restoring a Python-based integration testbed (`api-test`) for a legacy system. The previous automation scripts were flaky and left the environment in an inconsistent state. Your goal is to clean up the environment, resolve the correct package versions from a tiered configuration system, and generate specific artifacts compliant with our strict auditing standards.\n\n## 1. Environment Sanitization\n\nThe target directory for this project is `/home/user/api-test`. \n\n**Warning**: Due to previous failed runs, this path may currently exist as a symbolic link pointing to a temporary location, or as a corrupted file. You must ensure `api-test` is a clean, real directory before proceeding. Any existing content at that path should be removed.\n\n## 2. Configuration & Version Resolution\n\nYou need to install `httpx` and `requests`. The specific versions are defined in a tiered configuration system:\n\n*   **Global Config**: `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`\n*   **User Override**: `~/.pkg_override`\n\nThe configuration format is a simple key-value pair system (e.g., `package=version`). However, these files are often edited manually on Windows machines, so they may contain **Byte Order Marks (BOM)** and inconsistent whitespace around the equals sign. \n\n**Requirement**: You must read the Global Config, but if the User Override file exists, the versions defined there take precedence. You must parse these files robustly to extract the correct version strings.\n\n## 3. Virtual Environment & Patching\n\nCreate a standard Python virtual environment named `env` inside the project directory.\n\n**Critical Patch**: Our CI nodes have limited storage. You must modify the activation script (`env/bin/activate`) to disable pip caching. Append the following line to the very end of the activation script:\n`export PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1`\n\n## 4. Auditing Artifacts\n\nOnce the environment is set up and the packages are installed, you must generate three specific artifacts in `/home/user/api-test`. Note that the downstream systems consuming these files have strict, conflicting requirements regarding encoding and line endings.\n\n### A. `requirements.txt` (Windows Parser Compatibility)\n*   **Content**: Two lines (`httpx==<ver>`, `requests==<ver>`) sorted alphabetically.\n*   **Encoding**: This file must be encoded in **UTF-16LE** and must start with a **BOM** (Byte Order Mark).\n*   **Line Endings**: Standard `\\n` is acceptable here as the encoding handles the structure.\n\n### B. `install.log` (Log Aggregator Compatibility)\n*   **Content**: Two lines (`httpx <ver>`, `requests <ver>`) sorted alphabetically.\n*   **Encoding**: Standard UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings**: You **must** use Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n*   **Permissions**: This file is an audit record. Once written, it must be set to **read-only** mode (0444).\n\n### C. `inventory.json` (Chain of Custody)\n*   A JSON object containing verification hashes.\n*   Keys `httpx` and `requests`: The SHA256 hex digest of their requirement string (e.g., hash of `httpx==0.25.0`).\n*   Key `setup_hash`: The SHA256 hex digest of the **modified** `env/bin/activate` script (the content *after* you appended the export command).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\n1.  Clean directory `/home/user/api-test`.\n2.  Virtual env `env` with packages installed (versions resolved from override if present).\n3.  `env/bin/activate` patched with the export variable.\n4.  `requirements.txt` (UTF-16LE + BOM).\n5.  `install.log` (UTF-8, CRLF, Mode 0444).\n6.  `inventory.json` (including the hash of the patched activate script).\n\nComplete the task by creating a script that handles all steps automatically.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c4d1e36a-92a9-4173-b4fc-e8fb91996409:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Legacy Integration Testbed Setup\n\nYou are tasked with restoring a Python-based integration testbed (`api-test`) for a legacy system. The previous automation scripts were flaky and left the environment in an inconsistent state. Your goal is to clean up the environment, resolve the correct package versions from a tiered configuration system, and generate specific artifacts compliant with our strict auditing standards.\n\n## 1. Environment Sanitization\n\nThe target directory for this project is `/home/user/api-test`. \n\n**Warning**: Due to previous failed runs, this path may currently exist as a symbolic link pointing to a temporary location, or as a corrupted file. You must ensure `api-test` is a clean, real directory before proceeding. Any existing content at that path should be removed.\n\n## 2. Configuration & Version Resolution\n\nYou need to install `httpx` and `requests`. The specific versions are defined in a tiered configuration system:\n\n*   **Global Config**: `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`\n*   **User Override**: `~/.pkg_override`\n\nThe configuration format is a simple key-value pair system (e.g., `package=version`). However, these files are often edited manually on Windows machines, so they may contain **Byte Order Marks (BOM)** and inconsistent whitespace around the equals sign. \n\n**Requirement**: You must read the Global Config, but if the User Override file exists, the versions defined there take precedence. You must parse these files robustly to extract the correct version strings.\n\n## 3. Virtual Environment & Patching\n\nCreate a standard Python virtual environment named `env` inside the project directory.\n\n**Critical Patch**: Our CI nodes have limited storage. You must modify the activation script (`env/bin/activate`) to disable pip caching. Append the following line to the very end of the activation script:\n`export PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1`\n\n## 4. Auditing Artifacts\n\nOnce the environment is set up and the packages are installed, you must generate three specific artifacts in `/home/user/api-test`. Note that the downstream systems consuming these files have strict, conflicting requirements regarding encoding and line endings.\n\n### A. `requirements.txt` (Windows Parser Compatibility)\n*   **Content**: Two lines (`httpx==<ver>`, `requests==<ver>`) sorted alphabetically.\n*   **Encoding**: This file must be encoded in **UTF-16LE** and must start with a **BOM** (Byte Order Mark).\n*   **Line Endings**: Standard `\\n` is acceptable here as the encoding handles the structure.\n\n### B. `install.log` (Log Aggregator Compatibility)\n*   **Content**: Two lines (`httpx <ver>`, `requests <ver>`) sorted alphabetically.\n*   **Encoding**: Standard UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings**: You **must** use Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n*   **Permissions**: This file is an audit record. Once written, it must be set to **read-only** mode (0444).\n\n### C. `inventory.json` (Chain of Custody)\n*   A JSON object containing verification hashes.\n*   Keys `httpx` and `requests`: The SHA256 hex digest of their requirement string (e.g., hash of `httpx==0.25.0`).\n*   Key `setup_hash`: The SHA256 hex digest of the **modified** `env/bin/activate` script (the content *after* you appended the export command).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\n1.
