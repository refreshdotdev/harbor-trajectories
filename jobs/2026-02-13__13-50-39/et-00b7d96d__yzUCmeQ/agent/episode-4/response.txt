Generate the `install.log` file with package versions and installation status, formatted with UTF-8 encoding and Windows-style CRLF line endings. 4. Generate the `inventory.json` file containing the SHA256 hashes of the requirement strings for both packages and the hash of the patched activation script. 5. Set appropriate permissions on `install.log` (read-only).",
