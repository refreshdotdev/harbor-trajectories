  "analysis": "I am starting a new session on a Linux workstation. My task is to perform a security audit and remediation, specifically Incident 714-B. This involves creating a Python virtual environment, generating a package manifest with specific formatting and filtering rules, and then cryptographically signing this manifest. The environment has known issues like a corrupted global pip configuration, which I must bypass. The directory structure must be strictly followed, and the virtual environment's prompt must be customized. A key challenge will be handling the legacy banlist file, which is encoded in ISO-8859-1 and may have Windows-style line endings.",
  "plan": "First, I will navigate to the home directory and create the required root directory for the forensics work. Then, I will create a Python virtual environment named 'clean_env' within this directory. A critical step is to customize the activation script of this virtual environment to set the prompt to '(AUDIT_SAFE)', as mandated by Policy 714-B. I will then activate this environment to ensure the prompt is correct and that I'm working in an isolated Python space, bypassing the corrupted global pip configuration.",
