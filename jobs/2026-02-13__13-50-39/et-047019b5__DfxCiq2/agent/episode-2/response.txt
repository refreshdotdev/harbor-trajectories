The custom prompt `(AUDIT_SAFE)` is now active, confirming that the activation script modification was successful and that I am operating within the intended isolated Python environment. This is crucial for meeting the requirements of Policy 714-B and avoiding any issues with the globally corrupted pip configuration. The next phase involves preparing for package installation, specifically ensuring the `wheel` package is installed as required by the auditing tools.",
  "plan": "With the virtual environment active and the prompt confirmed, I will now install the `wheel` package using `pip install wheel`. This package is a prerequisite for the auditing tools. I will then run `pip freeze` to get a baseline list of installed packages. This list will later be filtered against the legacy banlist. It's important to install `wheel` before generating the final package inventory.",
