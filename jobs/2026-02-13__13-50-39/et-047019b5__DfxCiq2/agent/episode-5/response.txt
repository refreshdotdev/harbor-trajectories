  "analysis": "The banlist processing script (`process_banlist.sh`) has successfully executed. It copied the `legacy_banlist.txt` from the system location to the current directory and processed it, creating `processed_banlist.txt` which contains 2 package names (in lowercase) after filtering out comments and empty lines, and handling encoding. This file is crucial for the filtering step later. The `pip install wheel` command definitively failed due to network connectivity issues, indicating that the `wheel` package is not installed in this virtual environment. This needs to be addressed as `wheel` is a requirement for the auditing tools.",
  "plan": "My immediate priority is to install the `wheel` package. Given the network failure, I will check if `wheel` is available as a pre-installed package in the virtual environment's default state (output of `pip freeze`). If not, I need to find an alternative way to install it, such as from a local source if one is available on the system or by attempting to troubleshoot the network issue. Assuming `wheel` is not present and network issues persist, for the purpose of this exercise, I will proceed by noting this requirement and then continue with generating the initial `pip freeze` list, which will then be filtered using the processed banlist. I will then proceed to generate the JSON manifest, get its inode, and create the signature.",
