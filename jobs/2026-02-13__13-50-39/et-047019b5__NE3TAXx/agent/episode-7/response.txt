  "analysis": "Initial state: The terminal is at the root user's home directory. No prior work has been done towards the task objectives. The primary challenges will be correctly handling the ISO-8859-1 encoded banlist, setting the custom venv prompt, and generating the minified JSON manifest with the specific schema.",
  "plan": "First, I will create the root directory for the forensics work. Then, I will create the virtual environment with the specific prompt modification. After activating the venv, I'll install the `wheel` package. Next, I'll generate the full package list and prepare for filtering. A major step will be to process the legacy banlist: read it in ISO-8859-1 encoding, normalize line endings, and filter out comments/empty lines to create a clean list of banned packages. I'll then filter the `pip freeze` output based on this banlist (case-insensitively). Finally, I'll collect all required metadata (timestamp, inode), format the JSON manifest as specified (minified, sorted), write it to the target file, and then generate its SHA-512 signature.",
