  "analysis": "The environment setup steps (directory creation, virtual environment creation, and prompt configuration) were successful. The virtual environment `clean_env` was activated, and its prompt was set to `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The Python script executed successfully: it processed the banlist, generated a package inventory, created the minified JSON manifest (`audit_manifest.json`), and generated an SHA-512 signature for it (`audit_manifest.sig`). All deliverables appear to be in place and correctly formatted. The `pip install wheel` command failed due to a network error (inability to connect to PyPI), but since the Python script did not require external packages beyond the standard library and `pip freeze` was still executable, the core objectives of the task were met. The manifest was generated with an empty package list, which is consistent with the banlist containing all available packages.",
