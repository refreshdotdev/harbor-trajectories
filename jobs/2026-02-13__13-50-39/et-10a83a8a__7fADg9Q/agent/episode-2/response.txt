  "analysis": "The BOM removal approach using `sed '1s/^//}}//'` didn't work as expected - it seems the BOM bytes were treated differently. The iconv command also reported an illegal input sequence at position 0, suggesting the file might contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or the sed command corrupted the stream. I need to verify the template file and use a different approach for BOM removal that handles the specific EF BB BF bytes.",
  "plan": "First I'll examine the template file to understand its exact content and encoding. Then I'll use a more robust method to remove the BOM by matching the specific EF BB BF byte sequence. After that, I'll perform the substitution and encoding conversion to ISO-8859-1 and save the result.",
