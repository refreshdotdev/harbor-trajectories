I need to start from the beginning by creating the necessary directory structure and processing the template file.",

Next I'll process the template file by removing the BOM, performing substitutions, and converting the encoding to ISO-8859-1. After that I'll start the Python HTTP server in the background. Finally, I'll generate the audit manifest file with the required checksum and content length information.",
