You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# MLOps Legacy Migration & Consolidation Task

You are the lead Data Engineer for a migration project. We are consolidating experiment logs from several generations of our ML platform. The data is messy, distributed, and uses various legacy encoding standards. Your job is to produce a clean, verified inventory.

## 1. Input Sources

The experiment data resides in `/home/user/mlops/experiments/`. Each subdirectory represents an experiment. Within these directories, you must process any file named `artifacts.txt` or `artifacts.log`. 

**Warning**: Some of these files were generated by Windows systems (UTF-16LE with BOM) or older Linux systems (Latin-1). You must detect and handle these encodings automatically. If a file is standard UTF-8, process it normally.

## 2. Data Hygiene & Parsing Protocols

Each line in the log files follows the format: `ArtifactName | Status | Metadata`. 

Before parsing, you must validate the line integrity. Our legacy transmission protocol used whitespace parity. **Any line ending with an odd number of trailing spaces (excluding the newline character) is considered corrupted.** 
- You must NOT include corrupted lines in the inventory.
- You must write these corrupted lines exactly as they appear (bytes preserved) to `/home/user/mlops/summary/corruption_report.txt`.

For valid lines:
1.  Extract `ArtifactName` and `Status`.
2.  **Status Override**: Some experiments contain a `status_override.map` file (key=value format). If an artifact name appears in this map, the mapped status takes precedence over the log status.
3.  Filter: Keep ONLY artifacts where the final resolved status is `READY`.

## 3. Exclusion Policy

We have a directory of deprecated assets at `/home/user/mlops/deprecated/`. This directory contains empty placeholder files. 

- You must exclude any artifact whose **root name** (filename without extension) matches a filename in the `deprecated` folder (also without extension).
- This matching must be **case-insensitive**.
- Example: If `deprecated/Legacy_Model.old` exists, then `legacy_model.pt` in the logs must be excluded.

## 4. Output Specifications

You must generate a pipe-delimited inventory file at `/home/user/mlops/summary/inventory.csv`.

**Header**: `Artifact|NameHash|Locations`

**Columns**:
1.  `Artifact`: The trimmed artifact name.
2.  `NameHash`: The MD5 hash of the trimmed artifact name (hex digest).
3.  `Locations`: A sorted, semicolon-separated list of **relative paths** from `/home/user/mlops/` to the experiment directory (e.g., `experiments/exp_alpha`).

**Sorting**:
- Rows must be sorted alphabetically by `Artifact` (case-sensitive, standard POSIX sort).

## 5. Final Verification (The Manifest)

To ensure auditability, you must produce a YAML manifest at `/home/user/mlops/summary/manifest.yaml` containing:
- `total_artifacts`: The number of unique artifacts in the final inventory.
- `inventory_hash`: The SHA-256 checksum of the generated `inventory.csv` file.
- `generated_at`: The current UTC date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Constraints
- Do not use external libraries beyond the Python standard library.
- Work entirely within `/home/user/`.
- Ensure all output files are encoded in UTF-8.
- The `summary` directory does not exist and must be created.
