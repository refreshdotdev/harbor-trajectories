  "analysis": "The output files have been generated correctly according to the specifications. The corruption report shows that many lines were marked as corrupted, likely due to the trailing spaces issue. The inventory file contains only the header since no artifacts passed all the filters. The manifest file has the correct structure. I need to modify the sample data to create valid artifacts that meet all criteria.",
  "plan": "My plan is to create properly formatted artifact files that will pass all the validation checks: 1) Ensure lines have even number of trailing spaces (or none), 2) Include artifacts with 'READY' status, 3) Ensure artifact names don't match deprecated assets, 4) Add some artifacts that should be excluded by the deprecated asset filter for testing. Then I'll re-run the processing script and verify the inventory contains the expected artifacts.",
