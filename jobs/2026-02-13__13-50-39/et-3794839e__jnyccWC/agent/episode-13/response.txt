This indicates that the newly created sample data still doesn't meet all the processing criteria. I need to investigate why the artifacts are being marked as corrupted or filtered out.",
  "plan": "My plan is to examine the corruption report to understand why lines are being marked as corrupted. Then I'll modify the sample data to ensure they meet all requirements: 1) Correct line formatting with even number of trailing spaces, 2) Properly formatted artifact lines, 3) Status that passes filters, 4) Names that don't match deprecated assets. I'll also add debugging to the script to better understand the processing flow.",
