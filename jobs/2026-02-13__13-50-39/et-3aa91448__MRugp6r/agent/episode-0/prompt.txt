You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Security Incident Response: Firewall Hardening & Evidence Collection

You are a Senior Security Analyst at a legacy infrastructure provider. A partial breach has been detected on the host. You have been assigned ticket **INC-9942** to analyze traffic logs, generate a compliance report, and harden the firewall rules.

## Context & Constraints

This system is a legacy integration point. It uses specific character encodings and line-ending conventions that **must be strictly adhered to** for downstream systems to process your output. Failure to follow encoding standards will cause the central SIEM to reject the evidence.

**Warning:** The previous analyst left notes indicating that the log aggregation system has been misconfigured to output logs in a non-standard encoding. You must identify and handle this correctly.

## Input Data

All relevant files are located in `/home/user/data`:

1.  **`traffic.log`**: The raw packet capture logs. 
    *   *Note:* This file is known to cause "binary garbage" output when viewed with standard `cat` or `grep` commands on this terminal. You must handle its encoding programmatically.
2.  **`threat_intel.json`**: A JSON list of known threat actor IPs and their risk scores.
3.  **`maintenance_schedule.txt`**: A plain-text memo from the DevOps team detailing authorized scan windows.
4.  **`current_iptables.save`**: The existing firewall configuration (iptables-save format).

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Log Analysis & Scope Determination

1.  **Parse the Threat Intel**: Read `threat_intel.json`. You should only investigate IPs where the `status` field is explicitly set to `"active"`. Ignore any entries marked `"suspended"` or `"investigating"`.
2.  **Determine the Exclusion Window**: Read `maintenance_schedule.txt`. It contains a narrative description of a time window where traffic should be **ignored** (whitelisted). 
    *   You must parse the start and end times from the text.
    *   Traffic occurring *inclusively* within this window must **NOT** be counted as suspicious, even if it matches a threat IP.
    *   *Hint:* The memo uses ISO-8601-like strings (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) within the sentence.
3.  **Analyze Traffic**: Parse `traffic.log`.
    *   Identify all packets coming from the "active" threat IPs.
    *   Filter out any packets falling inside the exclusion window found in the text file.
    *   Aggregate the **count** of remaining suspicious packets per IP.

### Phase 2: Evidence Generation (Strict Formatting)

Create a file at `/home/user/evidence/report.csv` containing the analysis results.

*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded as **Windows-1252** (cp1252).
*   **Line Endings**: The file must use **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line endings.
*   **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `Source_IP,Risk_Score,Packet_Count`.
*   **Content**:
    *   Include only IPs that had at least one suspicious packet (after exclusion filtering).
    *   `Risk_Score` must be looked up from `threat_intel.json`.
    *   **Sorting**: Sort primarily by **Risk Score (Descending)**, and secondarily by **Packet Count (Descending)**.

### Phase 3: Firewall Hardening

Create a new rules file at `/home/user/firewall/hardened_rules.v4` based on `current_iptables.save`.

1.  **Preserve Integrity**: Keep all existing rules exactly as they are, including comments.
2.  **Insert Drops**: For every IP listed in your `report.csv` (i.e., active threats with out-of-window traffic):
    *   Insert a DROP rule: `-A INPUT -s <IP> -j DROP`.
    *   These rules must be placed **immediately after** the existing rule that accepts loopback traffic (`-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`).
    *   The order of insertion for these new rules must match the sort order of the CSV (Highest risk/count dropped first).
3.  **Encoding**: This file must be standard **UTF-8** with **Unix (LF)** line endings.

### Phase 4: Chain of Custody

To ensure the integrity of the evidence, you must generate a cryptographic manifest.

1.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `report.csv`.
2.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `hardened_rules.v4`.
3.  Create a file `/home/user/evidence/manifest.json` containing specific JSON structure:
    ```json
    {
      "analyst": "user",
      "artifacts": {
        "report.csv": "<sha256_hash>",
        "hardened_rules.v4": "<sha256_hash>"
      }
    }
    ```

## Summary of Deliverables

| File Path | Encoding | Line Endings | Key Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/home/user/evidence/report.csv` | **Windows-1252** | **CRLF** | Filtered by JSON status & Text window |
| `/home/user/firewall/hardened_rules.v4` | UTF-8 | LF | Inserted after loopback, sorted by risk |
| `/home/user/evidence/manifest.json` | UTF-8 | LF | Hashes of the above two files |

## Execution

*   Perform all actions as the standard `user`.
*   The directory `/home/user/evidence` and `/home/user/firewall` must be created if they do not exist.
*   Do not modify the input files in `/home/user/data`.
