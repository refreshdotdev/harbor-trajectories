A partial breach has been detected on the host. You have been assigned ticket **INC-9942** to analyze traffic logs, generate a compliance report, and harden the firewall rules.\n\n## Context & Constraints\n\nThis system is a legacy integration point. It uses specific character encodings and line-ending conventions that **must be strictly adhered to** for downstream systems to process your output. Failure to follow encoding standards will cause the central SIEM to reject the evidence.\n\n**Warning:** The previous analyst left notes indicating that the log aggregation system has been misconfigured to output logs in a non-standard encoding. You must identify and handle this correctly.\n\n## Input Data\n\nAll relevant files are located in `/home/user/data`:\n\n1.  **`traffic.log`**: The raw packet capture logs. \n    *   *Note:* This file is known to cause \"binary garbage\" output when viewed with standard `cat` or `grep` commands on this terminal. You must handle its encoding programmatically.\n2.  **`threat_intel.json`**: A JSON list of known threat actor IPs and their risk scores.\n3.  **`maintenance_schedule.txt`**: A plain-text memo from the DevOps team detailing authorized scan windows.\n4.  **`current_iptables.save`**: The existing firewall configuration (iptables-save format).\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Phase 1: Log Analysis & Scope Determination\n\n1.  **Parse the Threat Intel**: Read `threat_intel.json`. You should only investigate IPs where the `status` field is explicitly set to `\"active\"`. Ignore any entries marked `\"suspended\"` or `\"investigating\"`.\n2.  **Determine the Exclusion Window**: Read `maintenance_schedule.txt`. It contains a narrative description of a time window where traffic should be **ignored** (whitelisted). \n    *   You must parse the start and end times from the text.\n    *   Traffic occurring *inclusively* within this window must **NOT** be counted as suspicious, even if it matches a threat IP.\n    *   *Hint:* The memo uses ISO-8601-like strings (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) within the sentence.\n3.  **Analyze Traffic**: Parse `traffic.log`.\n    *   Identify all packets coming from the \"active\" threat IPs.\n    *   Filter out any packets falling inside the exclusion window found in the text file.\n    *   Aggregate the **count** of remaining suspicious packets per IP.\n\n### Phase 2: Evidence Generation (Strict Formatting)\n\nCreate a file at `/home/user/evidence/report.csv` containing the analysis results.\n\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded as **Windows-1252** (cp1252).\n*   **Line Endings**: The file must use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n*   **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `Source_IP,Risk_Score,Packet_Count`.\n*   **Content**:\n    *   Include only IPs that had at least one suspicious packet (after exclusion filtering).\n    *   `Risk_Score` must be looked up from `threat_intel.json`.\n    *   **Sorting**: Sort primarily by **Risk Score (Descending)**, and secondarily by **Packet Count (Descending)**.\n\n### Phase 3: Firewall Hardening\n\nCreate a new rules file at `/home/user/firewall/hardened_rules.v4` based on `current_iptables.save`.\n\n1.  **Preserve Integrity**: Keep all existing rules exactly as they are, including comments.\n2.  **Insert Drops**: For every IP listed in your `report.csv` (i.e., active threats with out-of-window traffic):\n    *   Insert a DROP rule: `-A INPUT -s <IP> -j DROP`.\n    *   These rules must be placed **immediately after** the existing rule that accepts loopback traffic (`-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`).\n    *   The order of insertion for these new rules must match the sort order of the CSV (Highest risk/count dropped first).\n3.  **Encoding**: This file must be standard **UTF-8** with **Unix (LF)** line endings.\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the evidence, you must generate a cryptographic manifest.\n\n1.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `report.csv`.\n2.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `hardened_rules.v4`.\n3.  Create a file `/home/user/evidence/manifest.json` containing specific JSON structure:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"analyst\": \"user\",\n      \"artifacts\": {\n        \"report.csv\": \"<sha256_hash>\",\n        \"hardened_rules.v4\": \"<sha256_hash>\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\n| File Path | Encoding | Line Endings | Key Requirement |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `/home/user/evidence/report.csv` | **Windows-1252** | **CRLF** | Filtered by JSON status & Text window |\n| `/home/user/firewall/hardened_rules.v4` | UTF-8 | LF | Inserted after loopback, sorted by risk |\n| `/home/user/evidence/manifest.json` | UTF-8 | LF | Hashes of the above two files |\n\n## Execution\n\n*   Perform all actions as the standard `user`.\n*   The directory `/home/user/evidence` and `/home/user/firewall` must be created if they do not exist.\n*   Do not modify the input files in `/home/user/data`.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@92332309-2701-47d5-9ad9-1302447f1d26:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration.

A partial breach has been detected on the host. You have been assigned ticket **INC-9942** to analyze traffic logs, generate a compliance report, and harden the firewall rules.\n\n## Context & Constraints\n\nThis system is a legacy integration point. It uses specific character encodings and line-ending conventions that **must be strictly adhered to** for downstream systems to process your output. Failure to follow encoding standards will cause the central SIEM to reject the evidence.\n\n**Warning:** The previous analyst left notes indicating that the log aggregation system has been misconfigured to output logs in a non-standard encoding. You must identify and handle this correctly.\n\n## Input Data\n\nAll relevant files are located in `/home/user/data`:\n\n1.  **`traffic.log`**: The raw packet capture logs. \n    *   *Note:* This file is known to cause \"binary garbage\" output when viewed with standard `cat` or `grep` commands on this terminal. You must handle its encoding programmatically.\n2.  **`threat_intel.json`**: A JSON list of known threat actor IPs and their risk scores.\n3.  **`maintenance_schedule.txt`**: A plain-text memo from the DevOps team detailing authorized scan windows.\n4.  **`current_iptables.save`**: The existing firewall configuration (iptables-save format).\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Phase 1: Log Analysis & Scope Determination\n\n1.  **Parse the Threat Intel**: Read `threat_intel.json`. You should only investigate IPs where the `status` field is explicitly set to `\"active\"`. Ignore any entries marked `\"suspended\"` or `\"investigating\"`.\n2.  **Determine the Exclusion Window**: Read `maintenance_schedule.txt`. It contains a narrative description of a time window where traffic should be **ignored** (whitelisted). \n    *   You must parse the start and end times from the text.\n    *   Traffic occurring *inclusively* within this window must **NOT** be counted as suspicious, even if it matches a threat IP.\n    *   *Hint:* The memo uses ISO-8601-like strings (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) within the sentence.\n3.  **Analyze Traffic**: Parse `traffic.log`.\n    *   Identify all packets coming from the \"active\" threat IPs.\n    *   Filter out any packets falling inside the exclusion window found in the text file.\n    *   Aggregate the **count** of remaining suspicious packets per IP.\n\n### Phase 2: Evidence Generation (Strict Formatting)\n\nCreate a file at `/home/user/evidence/report.csv` containing the analysis results.\n\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded as **Windows-1252** (cp1252).\n*   **Line Endings**: The file must use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n*   **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `Source_IP,Risk_Score,Packet_Count`.\n*   **Content**:\n    *   Include only IPs that had at least one suspicious packet (after exclusion filtering).\n    *   `Risk_Score` must be looked up from `threat_intel.json`.\n    *   **Sorting**: Sort primarily by **Risk Score (Descending)**, and secondarily by **Packet Count (Descending)**.\n\n### Phase 3: Firewall Hardening\n\nCreate a new rules file at `/home/user/firewall/hardened_rules.v4` based on `current_iptables.save`.\n\n1.  **Preserve Integrity**: Keep all existing rules exactly as they are, including comments.\n2.  **Insert Drops**: For every IP listed in your `report.csv` (i.e., active threats with out-of-window traffic):\n    *   Insert a DROP rule: `-A INPUT -s <IP> -j DROP`.\n    *   These rules must be placed **immediately after** the existing rule that accepts loopback traffic (`-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`).\n    *   The order of insertion for these new rules must match the sort order of the CSV (Highest risk/count dropped first).\n3.  **Encoding**: This file must be standard **UTF-8** with **Unix (LF)** line endings.\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the evidence, you must generate a cryptographic manifest.\n\n1.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `report.csv`.\n2.  Calculate the **SHA-256** hash of the generated `hardened_rules.v4`.\n3.
