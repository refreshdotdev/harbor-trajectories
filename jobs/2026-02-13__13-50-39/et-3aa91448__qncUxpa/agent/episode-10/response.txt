  "analysis": "I have copied `data/current_iptables.save` to `firewall/hardened_rules.v4`. Since the source file was empty, the destination file is also empty. This means no new firewall rules were added as `evidence/report.csv` contained no actionable IP addresses. The next step is to calculate the SHA-256 hashes of the generated artifacts: `evidence/report.csv` and `firewall/hardened_rules.v4`.",
  "plan": "I will use the `sha256sum` command to calculate the SHA-256 hash for `evidence/report.csv` and `firewall/hardened_rules.v4`. Then, I will create the `evidence/manifest.json` file with the specific JSON structure, including the analyst name and the calculated hashes. This will complete the chain of custody requirement.",
