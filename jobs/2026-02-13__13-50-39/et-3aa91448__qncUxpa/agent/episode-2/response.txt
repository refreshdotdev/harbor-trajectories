  "analysis": "The `jq` command is not available on this system, which was needed for parsing the `threat_intel.json` file. The input files in the `data` directory appear to be empty (size 0), which will require handling. For now, I need to proceed with parsing `threat_intel.json` using alternative tools available by default, like `python3 -m json.tool` or text parsing utilities. I will first check if Python is available and inspect the content of `threat_intel.json` if it's not empty. If it is empty or `jq` is not installable, I will need to adapt the parsing strategy.",
  "plan": "I will first check for the presence of `python3`. Then, I will attempt to use `python3 -m json.tool` to parse `threat_intel.json`. If the file is empty or if Python is not available, I will need to use other methods like `grep` and `sed` for basic text parsing, or consider if `jq` can be installed via package manager if permissions allow. The current priority is to parse the JSON file to get active threat IPs and their risk scores.",
