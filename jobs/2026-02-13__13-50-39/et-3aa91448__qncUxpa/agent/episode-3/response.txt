  "analysis": "Python 3.10.12 is available. However, the `data/threat_intel.json` file is completely empty. This means there are no active threat IPs to process. I will need to create a placeholder file for `active_threats.json` to maintain the expected file structure for later pipeline stages (like firewall rule generation), even if it contains no data. This will prevent errors in subsequent steps that expect this file to exist.",
  "plan": "I will create an empty `active_threats.json` file or one that represents an empty list of threats. Then, I will proceed to parse `data/maintenance_schedule.txt` to determine the exclusion window. If the threat list is empty, the subsequent analysis of `traffic.log` will yield no suspicious packets, and the final report will be empty. Firewall hardening will also result in no new rules being added.",
