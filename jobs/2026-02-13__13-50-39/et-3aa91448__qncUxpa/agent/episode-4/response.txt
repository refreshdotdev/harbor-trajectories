  "analysis": "The `data/maintenance_schedule.txt` file is also empty. This means there is no exclusion window defined, so all traffic from active threat IPs (which are currently none) would be considered suspicious. Given that the threat intel is empty, this will result in no suspicious packets being identified. I will note the absence of the exclusion window and proceed to analyze `data/traffic.log`.",
  "plan": "I will next examine `data/traffic.log`. Since this log is known to cause \"binary garbage\" output with standard tools, I'll use `file` to determine its type and `xxd` to inspect its encoding. Based on the findings, I will decide on the appropriate method for parsing (e.g., converting from UTF-16 to UTF-8 if necessary). If the file is also empty, the analysis will be straightforward.",
