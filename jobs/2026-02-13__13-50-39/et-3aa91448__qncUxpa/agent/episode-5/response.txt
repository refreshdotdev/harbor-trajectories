Since `threat_intel.json` is empty and there are no active threats, the traffic analysis phase will not identify any suspicious packets. I will proceed to the report generation phase. The report will be empty as no suspicious activity was found.",
  "plan": "I will create the `report.csv` file in `/home/user/evidence/` with the specified header. Given that there are no active threats and no suspicious packets, the body of the CSV will be empty. I will ensure the file uses Windows-1252 encoding and CRLF line endings. After that, I will move on to firewall hardening, which will also result in an empty set of new rules to add, essentially preserving the existing (empty) `current_iptables.save`.",
