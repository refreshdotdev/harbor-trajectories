A top-level directory called\n    `/home/user/workflows`\n    must exist.\n\n2.  Inside `/home/user/workflows` create a sub-directory named `image_cleanup` that contains exactly three sub-directories:\n    *   `input`\n    *   `output`\n    *   `temp`\n    \n    **Crucial Permission Requirement**: The `temp` directory must have the **sticky bit** set (permission mode `1777` or `chmod +t`).\n\n3.  The file that already exists at `/home/user/sample_images.txt` contains a raw, messy list of filenames. You must process this file and place the clean result at:\n    `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input/files_to_process.txt`\n    \n    **Data Cleaning Rules** (must be applied in order):\n    1.  Convert all filenames to **lowercase**.\n    2.  Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from each line.\n    3.  Remove any empty lines.\n    4.  Keep **ONLY** lines that end in `.jpg`.\n    5.  Remove duplicate lines.\n    6.  Sort the list alphabetically.\n\n4.  Inside `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/` create a shell script named `run.sh` that:\n    *   Is executable by the current user.\n    *   Starts with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.\n    *   When executed, it must count the number of lines in the sibling file `input/files_to_process.txt` and print exactly:\n        `Found N files to process.`\n        (where `N` is the actual number of lines).\n\n5.  Produce a plain-text log file at\n    `/home/user/workflows/setup.log`\n    whose contents must match *exactly* the format shown below (except for variable data like timestamp, hash, and size).\n\n#### Required format for setup.log:\n```\nSETUP COMPLETE\nTimestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\nDirectories:\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/output\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/temp\nFiles:\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/run.sh (executable)\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input/files_to_process.txt\nMetadata:\n- files_to_process.txt: [MD5_HASH] [SIZE_BYTES] bytes\n```\n\n#### Formatting rules for setup.log:\n*   \u201cSETUP COMPLETE\u201d must be the very first line.\n*   Timestamp must use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.\n*   The `Metadata:` section must list the MD5 checksum and size (in bytes) of the cleaned `files_to_process.txt`.\n    *   Example: `- files_to_process.txt: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 45 bytes`\n*   Do not include any extra lines or trailing spaces.\n\n#### Success criteria the automated test will check\n*   Directory structure exists, including the **sticky bit** on the `temp` folder.\n*   `files_to_process.txt` exists, contains the correctly cleaned/sorted data, and the original `sample_images.txt` is NOT deleted (it can remain or be removed, instruction doesn't specify, but the new file must be correct).\n*   `run.sh` is executable and outputs the correct message when run.\n*   `setup.log` exists, matches the format, and the checksum/size in the Metadata section matches the actual file on disk.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@4fa6b781-5ceb-4d57-b68e-47e62ee58bb3:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
