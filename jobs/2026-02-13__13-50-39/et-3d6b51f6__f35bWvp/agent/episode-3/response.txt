The `cat` command output shows it contains mixed-case filenames, extra whitespace, and empty lines, which is exactly the unclean data we need to process. The directory structure and placeholder files are already in place from the earlier steps.",
  "plan": "Now I will clean up the messy `sample_images.txt` file according to the specified rules and save the cleaned output to `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input/files_to_process.txt`. The cleaning will be done using a series of `awk` and `sed` commands combined in a pipeline to perform the following operations in sequence: trim whitespace, convert filenames to lowercase, remove empty lines, keep only lines ending in `.jpg`, remove duplicates, and finally sort the list alphabetically.",
