      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are an automation-workflow specialist who has just joined an on-going project.\nA colleague has left you a single text file that lists sample images to be processed, but the data is messy, and the rest of the expected workflow directory tree is missing.\nYour job is to put the proper structure in place, clean up the data file, create a functional shell script, and write a detailed log so the team\u2019s CI system can confirm everything was set up correctly.\n\n#### Required final state of the system\n1.  A top-level directory called\n    `/home/user/workflows`\n    must exist.\n\n2.  Inside `/home/user/workflows` create a sub-directory named `image_cleanup` that contains exactly three sub-directories:\n    *   `input`\n    *   `output`\n    *   `temp`\n    \n    **Crucial Permission Requirement**: The `temp` directory must have the **sticky bit** set (permission mode `1777` or `chmod +t`).\n\n3.  The file that already exists at `/home/user/sample_images.txt` contains a raw, messy list of filenames. You must process this file and place the clean result at:\n    `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input/files_to_process.txt`\n    \n    **Data Cleaning Rules** (must be applied in order):\n    1.  Convert all filenames to **lowercase**.\n    2.  Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from each line.\n    3.  Remove any empty lines.\n    4.  Keep **ONLY** lines that end in `.jpg`.\n    5.  Remove duplicate lines.\n    6.  Sort the list alphabetically.\n\n4.  Inside `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/` create a shell script named `run.sh` that:\n    *   Is executable by the current user.\n    *   Starts with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.\n    *   When executed, it must count the number of lines in the sibling file `input/files_to_process.txt` and print exactly:\n        `Found N files to process.`\n        (where `N` is the actual number of lines).\n\n5.  Produce a plain-text log file at\n    `/home/user/workflows/setup.log`\n    whose contents must match *exactly* the format shown below (except for variable data like timestamp, hash, and size).\n\n#### Required format for setup.log:\n```\nSETUP COMPLETE\nTimestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\nDirectories:\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/output\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/temp\nFiles:\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/run.sh (executable)\n- /home/user/workflows/image_cleanup/input/files_to_process.txt\nMetadata:\n- files_to_process.txt: [MD5_HASH] [SIZE_BYTES] bytes\n```\n\n#### Formatting rules for setup.log:\n*   \u201cSETUP COMPLETE\u201d must be the very first line.\n*   Timestamp must use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.\n*   The `Metadata:` section must list the MD5 checksum and size (in bytes) of the cleaned `files_to_process.txt`.\n    *   Example: `- files_to_process.txt: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 45 bytes`\n*   Do not include any extra lines or trailing spaces.\n\n#### Success criteria the automated test will check\n*   Directory structure exists, including the **sticky bit** on the `temp` folder.\n*   `files_to_process.txt` exists, contains the correctly cleaned/sorted data, and the original `sample_images.txt` is NOT deleted (it can remain or be removed, instruction doesn't specify, but the new file must be correct).\n*   `run.sh` is executable and outputs the correct message when run.\n*   `setup.log` exists, matches the format, and the checksum/size in the Metadata section matches the actual file on disk.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@d9894970-8094-47b7-973e-f2e918edc92a:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
