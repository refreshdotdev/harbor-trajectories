You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a database administrator who has been asked to formalise the way ad-hoc SQL files are “optimised”. A colleague left you an initial scratch directory, but the process needs to be robust, handle batch processing via environment variables, and produce structured metadata.

A colleague already placed a raw SQL batch file here (this file already exists when you start):
`/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_42.sql`

Your goal is to produce a final state that meets the following specifications:

*   A dedicated, *user-local* Python virtual environment exists at `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries`.
    *   The directory must have the standard structure of a Python virtual environment.
    *   Inside this environment, version **0.4.4** of the PyPI package “sqlparse” must be installed.
    *   A dependency lock file named `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt` must exist containing `sqlparse==0.4.4`.

*   A Python script named `/home/user/db_queries/process_batch.py` exists. The script must:
    *   Be runnable with the venv’s `python`.
    *   Read an environment variable named `DB_BATCH_ID` to determine which file to process. (For testing, you will use `DB_BATCH_ID=42`).
    *   Read the input file `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql`.
    *   Create a *verbatim* backup of the input file at `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_backup.sql`.
    *   Process each query in the input file using `sqlparse`:
        1.  Calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *original raw query string* (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace). This will be used for tracking.
        2.  Produce a **single-line** version of the query with SQL keywords upper-cased and spaces around comparison operators (e.g., “salary>50000” → “... salary > 50000 ...”). Ensure newlines are replaced by spaces.
        3.  Append a comment to the end of the optimized query in the format: ` -- id={md5_hash}`.
    *   Classify queries and write them to separate files (preserving order within each category):
        *   **Read Queries** (starting with `SELECT`, case-insensitive) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_read.sql`.
        *   **Write Queries** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_write.sql`.
    *   Ensure every SQL statement in the output files ends with a semicolon.

*   A JSON manifest file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_manifest.json` is created containing exactly:
    ```json
    {
      "batch_id": "{DB_BATCH_ID}",
      "read_count": <integer>,
      "write_count": <integer>
    }
    ```

*   A plain-text log file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_pipeline.log` is created containing exactly these lines:
    ```text
    PIPELINE START
    Batch ID: {DB_BATCH_ID}
    Input: raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql
    Processed: <total_queries>
    PIPELINE END
    ```

**Example for Batch 42:**
If `raw_batch_42.sql` contains `select * from t;`, the script (run with `DB_BATCH_ID=42`) should produce:
1. `raw_batch_42_backup.sql` (copy of original)
2. `batch_42_optimized_read.sql` containing: `SELECT * FROM t; -- id=<md5_of_original>`
3. `batch_42_optimized_write.sql` (empty if no write queries)
4. `batch_42_manifest.json`
5. `batch_42_pipeline.log`

As a final result, print the following to the terminal:
*   the first two lines of `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt`
*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_manifest.json`
*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_pipeline.log`

No root privileges are needed. Everything must be achievable from an ordinary user shell.
