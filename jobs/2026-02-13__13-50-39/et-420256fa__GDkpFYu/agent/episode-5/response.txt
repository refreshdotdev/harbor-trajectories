The manifest points to a file that does not exist, and there are no other obvious log files available. This indicates a potential issue with the logging system or manifest configuration.",

I will use a wildcard to list all files and then examine any non-manifest files to see if they contain the required JSON data. If no suitable files are found, I may need to report this issue or look for logs in other locations.",
