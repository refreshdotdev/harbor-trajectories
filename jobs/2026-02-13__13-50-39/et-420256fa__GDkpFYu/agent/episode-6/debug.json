Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Mobile Build Audit System v2.0\n\nYou are the lead Build Engineer for a mobile application pipeline. We are currently migrating our auditing infrastructure from a pure Linux environment to a hybrid environment that interfaces with legacy Windows-based reporting tools. You have been tasked with generating the definitive audit database and reports for the latest CI run.\n\n## 1. Input Data Source\n\nUnlike previous versions of this pipeline, the source of truth is no longer located in the user's home directory. The build system now dumps logs into a dedicated partition at `/var/lib/ci_logs/`.\n\nBecause the logging system rotates files frequently, you must first read the **manifest file** located at `/var/lib/ci_logs/manifest.xml`. This XML file contains an `<active_log>` tag which specifies the filename of the current valid dataset within that same directory. \n\n**Warning:** A deprecated `raw_builds.json` file may still exist in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/`. Do **NOT** use this file. It contains stale data and using it will result in immediate audit failure.\n\n**Data Format Note:** The active log file is generated by a C++ tool that occasionally injects standard C-style comments (`// comment`) into the JSON output for debugging purposes. You will need to strip these comments before parsing the JSON, as standard parsers may reject them.\n\n## 2. Database Schema\n\nYou must create and populate an SQLite database at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db`.\n\n### Table: `builds`\n*   `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (Auto-incrementing, starting at 1 based on input order)\n*   `commit_hash` TEXT NOT NULL\n*   `status` TEXT NOT NULL (Filter out any entries where status is \"SKIPPED\")\n*   `duration_sec` INTEGER NOT NULL (Convert `duration_ms` to seconds via integer division)\n*   `timestamp` TEXT NOT NULL (Convert epoch to ISO-8601 UTC, e.g., `2023-09-01T12:01:30Z`)\n*   `efficiency_score` REAL NOT NULL\n*   `verification_code` TEXT NOT NULL\n\n### Table: `artifacts`\n*   `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n*   `build_id` INTEGER NOT NULL (Foreign Key)\n*   `artifact_name` TEXT NOT NULL\n*   `size_kb` INTEGER NOT NULL (Convert bytes to KiB via integer division)\n\n### Field Logic\n\n**Efficiency Score:**\nThis metric is calculated as: `(Total Artifact Size in Bytes) / (Duration in Seconds)`. \n*   If duration is 0, the score is 0.00.\n*   **Crucial Rounding Rule:** The finance team uses this metric, so it must be rounded to exactly **2 decimal places** using **Standard Arithmetic Rounding** (Round Half Up). For example, `0.125` becomes `0.13`, unlike Python's default behavior which rounds to even.\n\n**Verification Code:**\nTo ensure data integrity, this column must contain the **first 8 characters** of the SHA-256 hexadecimal hash of the string formed by concatenating `commit_hash` and `status`.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\n\nYou must generate two reports in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/`.\n\n### A. Legacy Text Summary (`build_summary.log`)\nThis report is ingested by a legacy Windows tool. Consequently, it has strict encoding requirements:\n1.  **Encoding:** The file must be encoded in **Windows-1252** (CP1252), NOT UTF-8. This is critical because some artifact names may contain special characters (e.g., copyright symbols) that must render correctly on Windows.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All lines must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`).\n\n**Content Format:**\n```text\nBuild Summary Report\n\nCommit Hash    | Status     | Artifacts | Efficiency | Code\n--------------------------------------------------------------\na1b2c3d4       | SUCCESS    | 2         | 81920.00   | 9f86d081\ne5f6g7h8       | FAILED     | 1         | 0.13       | 1a2b3c4d\n```\n*   Header: \"Build Summary Report\" followed by an empty line.\n*   Columns: `Commit Hash`, `Status`, `Artifacts` (count), `Efficiency`, `Code`.\n*   Separator: 62 dashes.\n*   Alignment:\n    *   `Commit Hash`: Left-align, 15 chars.\n    *   `Status`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Artifacts`: Left-align, 10 chars.\n    *   `Efficiency`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Code`: Left-align, remaining width.\n\n### B. JSON Integrity Export (`build_metrics.json`)\nThis file provides a machine-readable verification of the text report.\n\n**Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"generated_at\": \"2023-09-04T10:00:00Z\",\n  \"summary_report_md5\": \"<32-char-md5-hash-of-build_summary.log>\",\n  \"builds\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"commit_hash\": \"a1b2c3d4\",\n      \"efficiency\": 81920.00\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n*   `generated_at`: Current UTC ISO-8601 timestamp.\n*   `summary_report_md5`: The MD5 checksum of the **final** `build_summary.log` file. This ensures the text report has not been tampered with.\n*   `builds`: List of builds sorted by ID, containing only `id`, `commit_hash`, and `efficiency`.\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  Database at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db` populated from the active log file in `/var/lib/ci_logs/`.\n2.  Text report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_summary.log` (Windows-1252, CRLF).\n3.  JSON report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_metrics.json` (containing MD5 of the text report).\n\nEnsure all file permissions allow the `user` account to read/write.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@1108476a-5bf7-488c-bd7b-fa9506f4d647:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Mobile Build Audit System v2.0\n\nYou are the lead Build Engineer for a mobile application pipeline. We are currently migrating our auditing infrastructure from a pure Linux environment to a hybrid environment that interfaces with legacy Windows-based reporting tools. You have been tasked with generating the definitive audit database and reports for the latest CI run.\n\n## 1. Input Data Source\n\nUnlike previous versions of this pipeline, the source of truth is no longer located in the user's home directory. The build system now dumps logs into a dedicated partition at `/var/lib/ci_logs/`.\n\nBecause the logging system rotates files frequently, you must first read the **manifest file** located at `/var/lib/ci_logs/manifest.xml`. This XML file contains an `<active_log>` tag which specifies the filename of the current valid dataset within that same directory. \n\n**Warning:** A deprecated `raw_builds.json` file may still exist in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/`. Do **NOT** use this file. It contains stale data and using it will result in immediate audit failure.\n\n**Data Format Note:** The active log file is generated by a C++ tool that occasionally injects standard C-style comments (`// comment`) into the JSON output for debugging purposes. You will need to strip these comments before parsing the JSON, as standard parsers may reject them.\n\n## 2. Database Schema\n\nYou must create and populate an SQLite database at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db`.\n\n### Table: `builds`\n*   `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (Auto-incrementing, starting at 1 based on input order)\n*   `commit_hash` TEXT NOT NULL\n*   `status` TEXT NOT NULL (Filter out any entries where status is \"SKIPPED\")\n*   `duration_sec` INTEGER NOT NULL (Convert `duration_ms` to seconds via integer division)\n*   `timestamp` TEXT NOT NULL (Convert epoch to ISO-8601 UTC, e.g., `2023-09-01T12:01:30Z`)\n*   `efficiency_score` REAL NOT NULL\n*   `verification_code` TEXT NOT NULL\n\n### Table: `artifacts`\n*   `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n*   `build_id` INTEGER NOT NULL (Foreign Key)\n*   `artifact_name` TEXT NOT NULL\n*   `size_kb` INTEGER NOT NULL (Convert bytes to KiB via integer division)\n\n### Field Logic\n\n**Efficiency Score:**\nThis metric is calculated as: `(Total Artifact Size in Bytes) / (Duration in Seconds)`. \n*   If duration is 0, the score is 0.00.\n*   **Crucial Rounding Rule:** The finance team uses this metric, so it must be rounded to exactly **2 decimal places** using **Standard Arithmetic Rounding** (Round Half Up). For example, `0.125` becomes `0.13`, unlike Python's default behavior which rounds to even.\n\n**Verification Code:**\nTo ensure data integrity, this column must contain the **first 8 characters** of the SHA-256 hexadecimal hash of the string formed by concatenating `commit_hash` and `status`.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\n\nYou must generate two reports in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/`.\n\n### A. Legacy Text Summary (`build_summary.log`)\nThis report is ingested by a legacy Windows tool. Consequently, it has strict encoding requirements:\n1.  **Encoding:** The file must be encoded in **Windows-1252** (CP1252), NOT UTF-8. This is critical because some artifact names may contain special characters (e.g., copyright symbols) that must render correctly on Windows.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All lines must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`).\n\n**Content Format:**\n```text\nBuild Summary Report\n\nCommit Hash    | Status     | Artifacts | Efficiency | Code\n--------------------------------------------------------------\na1b2c3d4       | SUCCESS    | 2         | 81920.00   | 9f86d081\ne5f6g7h8       | FAILED     | 1         | 0.13       | 1a2b3c4d\n```\n*   Header: \"Build Summary Report\" followed by an empty line.\n*   Columns: `Commit Hash`, `Status`, `Artifacts` (count), `Efficiency`, `Code`.\n*   Separator: 62 dashes.\n*   Alignment:\n    *   `Commit Hash`: Left-align, 15 chars.\n    *   `Status`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Artifacts`: Left-align, 10 chars.\n    *   `Efficiency`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Code`: Left-align, remaining width.\n\n### B. JSON Integrity Export (`build_metrics.json`)\nThis file provides a machine-readable verification of the text report.\n\n**Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"generated_at\": \"2023-09-04T10:00:00Z\",\n  \"summary_report_md5\": \"<32-char-md5-hash-of-build_summary.log>\",\n  \"builds\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"commit_hash\": \"a1b2c3d4\",\n      \"efficiency\": 81920.00\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n*   `generated_at`: Current UTC ISO-8601 timestamp.\n*   `summary_report_md5`: The MD5 checksum of the **final** `build_summary.log` file. This ensures the text report has not been tampered with.\n*   `builds`: List of builds sorted by ID, containing only `id`, `commit_hash`, and `efficiency`.\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  Database at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db` populated from the active log file in `/var/lib/ci_logs/`.\n2.  Text report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_summary.log` (Windows-1252, CRLF).\n3.  JSON report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_metrics.json` (containing MD5 of the text report).\n\nEnsure all file permissions allow the `user` account to read/write.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@1108476a-5bf7-488c-bd7b-fa9506f4d647:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For example, `0.125` becomes `0.13`, unlike Python's default behavior which rounds to even.\n\n**Verification Code:**\nTo ensure data integrity, this column must contain the **first 8 characters** of the SHA-256 hexadecimal hash of the string formed by concatenating `commit_hash` and `status`.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\n\nYou must generate two reports in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/`.\n\n### A. Legacy Text Summary (`build_summary.log`)\nThis report is ingested by a legacy Windows tool. Consequently, it has strict encoding requirements:\n1.  **Encoding:** The file must be encoded in **Windows-1252** (CP1252), NOT UTF-8. This is critical because some artifact names may contain special characters (e.g., copyright symbols) that must render correctly on Windows.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All lines must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`).\n\n**Content Format:**\n```text\nBuild Summary Report\n\nCommit Hash    | Status     | Artifacts | Efficiency | Code\n--------------------------------------------------------------\na1b2c3d4       | SUCCESS    | 2         | 81920.00   | 9f86d081\ne5f6g7h8       | FAILED     | 1         | 0.13       | 1a2b3c4d\n```\n*   Header: \"Build Summary Report\" followed by an empty line.\n*   Columns: `Commit Hash`, `Status`, `Artifacts` (count), `Efficiency`, `Code`.\n*   Separator: 62 dashes.\n*   Alignment:\n    *   `Commit Hash`: Left-align, 15 chars.\n    *   `Status`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Artifacts`: Left-align, 10 chars.\n    *   `Efficiency`: Left-align, 11 chars.\n    *   `Code`: Left-align, remaining width.\n\n### B. JSON Integrity Export (`build_metrics.json`)\nThis file provides a machine-readable verification of the text report.\n\n**Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"generated_at\": \"2023-09-04T10:00:00Z\",\n  \"summary_report_md5\": \"<32-char-md5-hash-of-build_summary.log>\",\n  \"builds\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"commit_hash\": \"a1b2c3d4\",\n      \"efficiency\": 81920.00\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n*   `generated_at`: Current UTC ISO-8601 timestamp.\n*   `summary_report_md5`: The MD5 checksum of the **final** `build_summary.log` file. This ensures the text report has not been tampered with.\n*   `builds`: List of builds sorted by ID, containing only `id`, `commit_hash`, and `efficiency`.\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  Database at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db` populated from the active log file in `/var/lib/ci_logs/`.\n2.  Text report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_summary.log` (Windows-1252, CRLF).\n3.  JSON report at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/build_metrics.json` (containing MD5 of the text report).\n\nEnsure all file permissions allow the `user` account to read/write.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@1108476a-5bf7-488c-bd7b-fa9506f4d647:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
