This confirms that the expected build data file is not available in any standard location on the file system. Given the instructions, I must not use the deprecated `raw_builds.json` file. This leaves me with no valid data source to proceed with the audit.",
  "plan": "Since there is no valid log data available, I cannot proceed with generating the database and reports. I will create a placeholder structure in the target directory to indicate that the data was missing, and I will document the issue. I will also create a minimal SQLite database with an empty table to satisfy some of the requirements, but the data will not be populated.",
