The active log file referenced in manifest.xml ('build_dump_v2.json') is missing from the /var/lib/ci_logs directory. This creates a blocker for the task. I need to document this issue and consider what alternative approaches might be available.",

If no suitable data source is found, I'll need to create a placeholder database and reports indicating the data was unavailable.",
