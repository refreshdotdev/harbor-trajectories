The task was already marked complete in my previous response, and the terminal output shows that all commands were executed successfully. The diagnostic bundle is fully created including the script, it's executable, and the sample targets file is in place. The script implements all the required functionality for network diagnostics including parallel execution, log rotation, Base64 encoding, atomic writes with file locking, and checksum generation.

The terminal output confirms:
1. The directory `/home/user/diagnostics` was created
2. The script `/home/user/diagnostics/run_net_checks.sh` was created with the correct content and made executable
3. The targets file `/home/user/diagnostics/targets.txt` was created with sample hosts
4. File permissions were properly set

Therefore, the task is complete as requested.
