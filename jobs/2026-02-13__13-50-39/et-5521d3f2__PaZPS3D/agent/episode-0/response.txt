The task requires me to locate a configuration file, recover source code from an archive, set up a workspace, create a Python virtual environment, and generate a compliance report. No prior steps have been taken according to the terminal output.",
  "plan": "My first step is to determine the path to the QA configuration file. I'll check if the `QA_SETTINGS` environment variable is set. If it is, I'll use that path; otherwise, I'll default to `~/.config/qa/default.ini`. Then, I'll read the `log_path` from the `[Reporting]` section of this configuration file to know where to save the final report. I'll also verify the existence and location of the source archives directory and the manifest file.",
