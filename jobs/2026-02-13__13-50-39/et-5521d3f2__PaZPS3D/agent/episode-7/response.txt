Now I have all the necessary information to generate the compliance report: the first line of pytest's output (a single dot '.'), the session ID ('SESSION-9942-ALPHA'), and the MD5 hash of the test_sample.py file ('2411ea4bde54308f44c0134d8f699a7e').",
  "plan": "I will now construct the report content and save it to the specified log path. The log path from the configuration file is `./qa_reports/audit_v1.log`, and since the task specifies that relative paths should be resolved relative to the user's home directory (`/home/user`), I will ensure the report is saved to `/home/user/qa_reports/audit_v1.log`. The file must be encoded in ISO-8859-1 and use CRLF line endings.",
