  "analysis": "The `devices.txt` file exists in `/home/user/iot_deployment` but appears to be empty (file size is 0 bytes). This presents a challenge because the generation of `ping_summary.csv` and the `reachable_devices`/`unreachable_devices` fields in `system_report.json` depend on the content of `devices.txt`. With no IP addresses to process, these sections will be empty or contain default values. The rest of the diagnostic bundle can still be generated.",
  "plan": "Proceed with generating the diagnostic bundle while accounting for the empty `devices.txt` file. The plan is as follows:\n1. Create the `diagnostics` subdirectory.\n2. Generate `system_report.json` using system commands. For the `reachable_devices` and `unreachable_devices` fields, since there are no IPs to test, these arrays will be empty.\n3. Generate `ping_summary.csv`. Since there are no devices to test, this file will contain only the header row.\n4. Generate `integrity.sha256` for the two created files.\n5. Set the correct permissions on the `diagnostics` directory and the three files.\n\nThe next step is to create the `diagnostics` directory and begin collecting data for `system_report.json`.",
