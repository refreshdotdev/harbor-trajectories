  "analysis": "I am starting fresh in the /home/user directory. The task requires me to create a diagnostics bundle in /home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics, including a system report JSON, a ping summary CSV, and a SHA256 integrity file. I need to parse devices.txt, gather various system metrics, test network connectivity, and format the output precisely as specified. The first step will be to navigate to the base directory and examine the existing devices.txt file.",
  "plan": "1. Navigate to the project base directory. 2. Examine the contents of devices.txt to see what IP addresses need to be parsed and pinged. 3. Create the diagnostics subdirectory if it doesn't exist. 4. Begin gathering system information (hostname, kernel, uptime, load average, memory, disk usage) and process data (top processes). 5. Parse devices.txt to extract valid IP addresses. 6. Ping each IP address to determine reachability and latency. 7. Generate the system_report.json file with all collected data, ensuring proper formatting. 8. Generate the ping_summary.csv file sorted by latency. 9. Create the integrity.sha256 file. 10. Set appropriate permissions on the diagnostics directory and files.",
