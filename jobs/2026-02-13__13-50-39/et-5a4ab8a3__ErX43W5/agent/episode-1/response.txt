Since the file is empty, I will need to handle the 'reachable_devices' and 'unreachable_devices' arrays in system_report.json, and the ping_summary.csv file, appropriately for an empty list of target IPs. 4. Proceed with creating the diagnostics directory and gathering system information that doesn't depend on devices.txt.",
