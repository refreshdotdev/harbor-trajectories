            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are working as an edge-computing engineer preparing a single-board IoT gateway for field deployment. Management has asked you to gather a precise \u201cpre-flight\u201d diagnostic bundle that must be archived on the device before it leaves the lab.\n\nA directory named `/home/user/iot_deployment` already exists and contains a file named `devices.txt`.\n*   This file contains a list of IPv4 addresses (one per line) that the gateway should be able to reach.\n*   **Note**: The file may contain comments (lines starting with `#`), blank lines, or leading/trailing whitespace. You must parse it to extract only valid non-empty IP addresses.\n*   DO NOT modify `devices.txt` \u2013 only read from it.\n\nA new sub-directory must be created: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics` (Create it if it does not already exist.)\n\nInside that `diagnostics` directory, generate THREE artefacts whose exact paths, filenames and formats must match the following specifications; **the automated tests will fail if there are spelling/formatting deviations.**\n\n#### Artefact 1: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/system_report.json`\n*   UTF-8 encoded, one single JSON object (no surrounding array, no trailing commas, pretty-printed with 2-space indents).\n*   Mandatory key layout:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2023-11-28T14:33:59Z>\",\n      \"hostname\": \"<output of the hostname command>\",\n      \"kernel\": \"<output of uname \u2011srv>\",\n      \"uptime_seconds\": <integer seconds since boot>,\n      \"load_average\": {\n        \"1min\": <float>,\n        \"5min\": <float>,\n        \"15min\": <float>\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"total_MB\": <int>,\n        \"used_MB\": <int>,\n        \"free_MB\": <int>\n      },\n      \"disk_usage\": [\n        {\n          \"mountpoint\": \"<string>\",\n          \"filesystem\": \"<string>\",\n          \"size_GB\": <float>,\n          \"used_GB\": <float>,\n          \"free_GB\": <float>,\n          \"percent_used\": <int>\n        }\n        ...

Numeric values are floats (GB) or int (percent).\n*   **`top_processes`**: List the top 5 processes by instantaneous CPU usage. **Exclude kernel threads** (processes where the `command` is surrounded by square brackets, e.g., `[kthreadd]`).\n*   **`reachable_devices`/`unreachable_devices`**: Decided by sending up to 3 ICMP echo requests (ping) to each valid IP from `devices.txt`; if at least one reply arrives the IP is \u201creachable\u201d.\n\n#### Artefact 2: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/ping_summary.csv`\n*   UTF-8 text, Unix line endings.\n*   First line is a header **exactly**: `ip,status,latency_ms`\n*   One subsequent line per valid IP found in `devices.txt`.\n*   **Sorting**: The rows must be sorted by **`latency_ms` in descending order** (highest latency first). Devices with status `unreachable` (latency `N/A`) must appear at the **bottom** of the list.\n*   `status` is either `reachable` or `unreachable` (lower-case).\n*   `latency_ms` is the average round-trip time across the successful replies rounded to 2 decimal places; use \u201cN/A\u201d (without quotes) if unreachable.\n\n#### Artefact 3: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/integrity.sha256`\n*   A text file containing the SHA256 checksums of `system_report.json` and `ping_summary.csv`.\n*   Format: Standard `sha256sum` output (hash followed by two spaces and the filename).\n*   **Constraint**: The filenames listed must be **relative** (e.g., `system_report.json`), not absolute paths.\n\n#### Permissions & Security\n*   All three files inside `diagnostics` must be **read-only** for everyone (mode `0444` or `r--r--r--`).\n*   The `diagnostics` directory itself must be mode `0755`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@61a25424-ff3d-44a0-b881-b8fddcd35b14:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are working as an edge-computing engineer preparing a single-board IoT gateway for field deployment. Management has asked you to gather a precise \u201cpre-flight\u201d diagnostic bundle that must be archived on the device before it leaves the lab.\n\nA directory named `/home/user/iot_deployment` already exists and contains a file named `devices.txt`.\n*   This file contains a list of IPv4 addresses (one per line) that the gateway should be able to reach.\n*   **Note**: The file may contain comments (lines starting with `#`), blank lines, or leading/trailing whitespace. You must parse it to extract only valid non-empty IP addresses.\n*   DO NOT modify `devices.txt` \u2013 only read from it.\n\nA new sub-directory must be created: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics` (Create it if it does not already exist.)\n\nInside that `diagnostics` directory, generate THREE artefacts whose exact paths, filenames and formats must match the following specifications; **the automated tests will fail if there are spelling/formatting deviations.**\n\n#### Artefact 1: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/system_report.json`\n*   UTF-8 encoded, one single JSON object (no surrounding array, no trailing commas, pretty-printed with 2-space indents).\n*   Mandatory key layout:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2023-11-28T14:33:59Z>\",\n      \"hostname\": \"<output of the hostname command>\",\n      \"kernel\": \"<output of uname \u2011srv>\",\n      \"uptime_seconds\": <integer seconds since boot>,\n      \"load_average\": {\n        \"1min\": <float>,\n        \"5min\": <float>,\n        \"15min\": <float>\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"total_MB\": <int>,\n        \"used_MB\": <int>,\n        \"free_MB\": <int>\n      },\n      \"disk_usage\": [\n        {\n          \"mountpoint\": \"<string>\",\n          \"filesystem\": \"<string>\",\n          \"size_GB\": <float>,\n          \"used_GB\": <float>,\n          \"free_GB\": <float>,\n          \"percent_used\": <int>\n        }\n        ...

Numeric values are floats (GB) or int (percent).\n*   **`top_processes`**: List the top 5 processes by instantaneous CPU usage. **Exclude kernel threads** (processes where the `command` is surrounded by square brackets, e.g., `[kthreadd]`).\n*   **`reachable_devices`/`unreachable_devices`**: Decided by sending up to 3 ICMP echo requests (ping) to each valid IP from `devices.txt`; if at least one reply arrives the IP is \u201creachable\u201d.\n\n#### Artefact 2: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/ping_summary.csv`\n*   UTF-8 text, Unix line endings.\n*   First line is a header **exactly**: `ip,status,latency_ms`\n*   One subsequent line per valid IP found in `devices.txt`.\n*   **Sorting**: The rows must be sorted by **`latency_ms` in descending order** (highest latency first). Devices with status `unreachable` (latency `N/A`) must appear at the **bottom** of the list.\n*   `status` is either `reachable` or `unreachable` (lower-case).\n*   `latency_ms` is the average round-trip time across the successful replies rounded to 2 decimal places; use \u201cN/A\u201d (without quotes) if unreachable.\n\n#### Artefact 3: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/integrity.sha256`\n*   A text file containing the SHA256 checksums of `system_report.json` and `ping_summary.csv`.\n*   Format: Standard `sha256sum` output (hash followed by two spaces and the filename).\n*   **Constraint**: The filenames listed must be **relative** (e.g., `system_report.json`), not absolute paths.\n\n#### Permissions & Security\n*   All three files inside `diagnostics` must be **read-only** for everyone (mode `0444` or `r--r--r--`).\n*   The `diagnostics` directory itself must be mode `0755`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@61a25424-ff3d-44a0-b881-b8fddcd35b14:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You must parse it to extract only valid non-empty IP addresses.\n*   DO NOT modify `devices.txt` \u2013 only read from it.\n\nA new sub-directory must be created: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics` (Create it if it does not already exist.)\n\nInside that `diagnostics` directory, generate THREE artefacts whose exact paths, filenames and formats must match the following specifications; **the automated tests will fail if there are spelling/formatting deviations.**\n\n#### Artefact 1: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/system_report.json`\n*   UTF-8 encoded, one single JSON object (no surrounding array, no trailing commas, pretty-printed with 2-space indents).\n*   Mandatory key layout:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2023-11-28T14:33:59Z>\",\n      \"hostname\": \"<output of the hostname command>\",\n      \"kernel\": \"<output of uname \u2011srv>\",\n      \"uptime_seconds\": <integer seconds since boot>,\n      \"load_average\": {\n        \"1min\": <float>,\n        \"5min\": <float>,\n        \"15min\": <float>\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"total_MB\": <int>,\n        \"used_MB\": <int>,\n        \"free_MB\": <int>\n      },\n      \"disk_usage\": [\n        {\n          \"mountpoint\": \"<string>\",\n          \"filesystem\": \"<string>\",\n          \"size_GB\": <float>,\n          \"used_GB\": <float>,\n          \"free_GB\": <float>,\n          \"percent_used\": <int>\n        }\n        ...

Numeric values are floats (GB) or int (percent).\n*   **`top_processes`**: List the top 5 processes by instantaneous CPU usage. **Exclude kernel threads** (processes where the `command` is surrounded by square brackets, e.g., `[kthreadd]`).\n*   **`reachable_devices`/`unreachable_devices`**: Decided by sending up to 3 ICMP echo requests (ping) to each valid IP from `devices.txt`; if at least one reply arrives the IP is \u201creachable\u201d.\n\n#### Artefact 2: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/ping_summary.csv`\n*   UTF-8 text, Unix line endings.\n*   First line is a header **exactly**: `ip,status,latency_ms`\n*   One subsequent line per valid IP found in `devices.txt`.\n*   **Sorting**: The rows must be sorted by **`latency_ms` in descending order** (highest latency first). Devices with status `unreachable` (latency `N/A`) must appear at the **bottom** of the list.\n*   `status` is either `reachable` or `unreachable` (lower-case).\n*   `latency_ms` is the average round-trip time across the successful replies rounded to 2 decimal places; use \u201cN/A\u201d (without quotes) if unreachable.\n\n#### Artefact 3: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/integrity.sha256`\n*   A text file containing the SHA256 checksums of `system_report.json` and `ping_summary.csv`.\n*   Format: Standard `sha256sum` output (hash followed by two spaces and the filename).\n*   **Constraint**: The filenames listed must be **relative** (e.g., `system_report.json`), not absolute paths.\n\n#### Permissions & Security\n*   All three files inside `diagnostics` must be **read-only** for everyone (mode `0444` or `r--r--r--`).\n*   The `diagnostics` directory itself must be mode `0755`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@61a25424-ff3d-44a0-b881-b8fddcd35b14:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
