You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a FinOps analyst who has been asked to produce a concise cost summary from raw Google-Cloud-usage CSV logs that reside on the workstation. Everything must be done strictly from the Linux terminal, without installing third-party programs other than what is already available in a typical Debian/Ubuntu environment.

1.  **Raw data location**
    *   Folder: `/home/user/cloud_logs`
    *   Files: The directory contains multiple files named `usage-YYYY-MM.csv`. You must process **all** such files found, sorted chronologically.

2.  **CSV format and Data Quality**
    *   Header is always the first line: `resource_id,service,usage_hours,cost`
    *   **Warning:** The data is messy. Fields may contain leading/trailing whitespace which must be trimmed. The files may contain empty lines which must be ignored.
    *   **Filtering:** Any row where the `service` name contains the text "Trial" (case-insensitive) must be strictly **excluded** from all calculations.

3.  **Required calculations per month**
    For each valid file (representing a month):
    a.  **Subtotal:** The sum of the clean "cost" column.
    b.  **Tax:** Calculate tax on the Subtotal using the rate defined in the environment variable `CORP_TAX_RATE` (e.g., `0.05` for 5%). If the variable is not set, default to `0.08`. Round the tax amount to exactly two decimal places.
    c.  **Total:** Subtotal + Tax.
    d.  **Service Breakdown:** Sum of costs per service (using the cleaned service name). Identify the 3 most expensive services, sorted descending.

4.  **Expected output artefact**
    Create the single text file `/home/user/cloud_logs/reports/cost_summary_report.txt`.
    The directory `/home/user/cloud_logs/reports` does not exist yet; create it.

    The file must follow this **exact** structure:
    ```
    CLOUD COST SUMMARY REPORT
    == <Month_Name> <Year> ==
    Subtotal: $<amount>
    Tax: $<amount>
    Total: $<amount>
    Service Breakdown:
      <Service-1>: $<cost>
      <Service-2>: $<cost>
      ... sorted by decreasing cost ...
    Top 3 Services: <Service-A>, <Service-B>, <Service-C>

    == <Next_Month_Name> <Year> ==
    ... same structure ...

    [CHECKSUM]: <sha256_hash>
    ```
    
    **Footer Requirement:** The very last line of the file must be `[CHECKSUM]: <hash>`, where `<hash>` is the SHA-256 hexadecimal digest of all preceding content in the file (everything up to, but not including, the `[CHECKSUM]:` line). Ensure there is a blank line (empty line) between the last month's data and the checksum line.

5.  **Additional requirements**
    *   Do *not* modify, delete or rename the original CSV files.
    *   All money values must be formatted to exactly two decimal places (e.g., `150.00`).
    *   Service names in the output must be the trimmed versions from the CSV.
    *   Date headers (e.g., "September 2023") must be derived from the filename `usage-YYYY-MM.csv`.
