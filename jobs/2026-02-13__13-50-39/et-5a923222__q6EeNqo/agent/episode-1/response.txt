The `ls -la` command confirmed the presence of three CSV files: `usage-2023-09.csv`, `usage-2023-10.csv`, and `usage-2023-11.csv`. These files match the required naming pattern. The `reports` subdirectory has been successfully created. The next step is to inspect the structure of one of the CSV files to understand its format and content, which is crucial for the data processing script.",
  "plan": "1. Examine the first few lines of one of the CSV files (e.g., `usage-2023-09.csv`) to verify the header format (`resource_id,service,usage_hours,cost`) and to observe the raw data quality (e.g., presence of whitespace, empty lines). 2. Identify the tax rate by checking the environment variable `CORP_TAX_RATE`. If it's not set, the default tax rate of 0.08 will be used.",
