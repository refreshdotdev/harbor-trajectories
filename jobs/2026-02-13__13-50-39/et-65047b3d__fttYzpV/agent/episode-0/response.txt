  "analysis": "The current terminal session is running as the root user on a Linux system. The task requires me to clean up an experiment environment, set up a compliant Python virtual environment, install numpy, and generate specific artifacts. The first step is to address the target directory `/home/user/exp1`, which might be in an inconsistent state (file, symlink, or locked directory). It must be completely removed before proceeding.",
  "plan": "First, I will identify the nature of the `/home/user/exp1` item using `stat` to determine if it's a file, directory, or symlink. Then, I will use `rm` to remove it. If `rm` encounters issues (like the item being a directory), I'll use `rm -rf`. After successful removal, I will verify the path is clear using `ls -la /home/user/exp1`. If the path still exists or if `ls` shows an error, I will attempt to remove it again more forcefully. Once the path is clean, I will proceed to create the directory structure and set up the virtual environment.",
