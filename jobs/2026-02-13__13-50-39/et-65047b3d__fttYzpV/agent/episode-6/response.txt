Now I need to generate the `venv_info.log` file in the `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts` directory. This file must contain specific information, use ISO-8859-1 encoding, and Windows-style CRLF line endings.",
  "plan": "I will use a here-document with `cat` to create the `venv_info.log` file. I'll use `unix2dos` to convert the line endings to CRLF. Since `unix2dos` might not be installed by default, I will first check for its presence and install it if necessary. The micro symbol `\u00b5` in `Phoenix_µ1` needs to be represented by the byte `0xB5` in ISO-8859-1, which standard UTF-8 encoding will handle correctly when the file is saved and then processed or viewed as ISO-8859-1.",
