  "analysis": "The `which unix2dos` command yielded no output, indicating that the `unix2dos` utility is not installed on this system. Since `unix2dos` is not available, I will use an alternative method to ensure the `venv_info.log` file uses Windows-style CRLF line endings. I can achieve this by appending `\r` before each `\n` when creating the file, or by using tools like `sed` or `awk` if more complex processing is needed, or even by using Python to write the file with CRLF. For this task, I'll use a `cat` here-document and then pipe it through a simple `sed` command to replace LF with CRLF.",
  "plan": "I will generate the content for `venv_info.log` using a `cat` here-document. The content will be piped into `sed -i 's/$/\\r/'` to append a carriage return before each linefeed. After creating the file, I'll verify its content. This approach ensures that the line endings are CRLF as required.",
