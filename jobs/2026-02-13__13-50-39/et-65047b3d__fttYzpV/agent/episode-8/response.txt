  "analysis": "The `venv_info.log` file has been created with the specified content and the correct CRLF line endings are confirmed by `cat -v` (which shows `^M` at the end of each line). The micro symbol in `Phoenix_µ1` is also correctly represented (it appears as `M-BM-51` in `cat -v` output, which is a common way `cat -v` displays non-printing ASCII or meta-characters, but the actual byte is what matters). The next step is to create the `manifest.json` file, which requires the exact byte size of the `venv_info.log` file.",
  "plan": "I will use `wc -c` to get the byte count of `venv_info.log`. Then, I'll use `cat` with a here-document or a simple `echo` command to create the `manifest.json` file with the required JSON content, including the byte count. The `manifest.json` file can be UTF-8 encoded as per task specifications.",
