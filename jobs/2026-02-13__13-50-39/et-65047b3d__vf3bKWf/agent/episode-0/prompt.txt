You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# MLOps Environment Recovery Task

You are taking over a failed experiment run left by a previous engineer ("Devin") who was let go for failing to adhere to strict corporate compliance standards. Your goal is to clean up the environment, set up a compliant virtual environment, and generate the required artifact manifest for the Windows-based ingestion pipeline.

## 1. Environment Cleanup

The target directory for this experiment is `/home/user/exp1`. 

**Warning:** The previous engineer left this directory in an inconsistent state (it might be a file, a symlink, or a locked directory). You must completely remove any existing item at that path before proceeding. Failure to start with a clean slate will cause the build verification to fail.

## 2. Virtual Environment Setup

Create a new Python virtual environment inside `/home/user/exp1` named `.venv`. 

**Critical Configuration:**
- You must use the builtin `venv` module.
- The shell prompt for this environment must be strictly configured as `exp1_env`.
- **Troubleshooting Hint:** The previous engineer was known to mess with global environment variables (specifically regarding `pip` configuration) in the shell startup files. If you encounter connectivity errors when using `pip`, check the environment variables and unset any that point to invalid configuration files.

## 3. Package Installation

Activate the environment and install `numpy` version `1.23.5`.

## 4. Artifact Generation & Compliance Standards

This is where the previous engineer failed. Our downstream data ingestion pipeline runs on legacy Windows servers (Server 2012 R2). Therefore, all text artifacts generated in the `experiment_artifacts` subdirectory must adhere to the **"Legacy Windows Compatibility"** standard defined in the 2018 Operations Handbook.

### The "Legacy Windows Compatibility" Standard:
1.  **Encoding:** All text files must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.
2.  **Line Endings:** All text files must use Windows-style Carriage Return + Line Feed (**CRLF**) line terminators (`\r\n`), not standard Linux LF (`\n`).

### Required Artifacts

You must generate two files in `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts`:

#### A. `venv_info.log`
This file must contain exactly four lines in the following order:

    PROJECT=Phoenix_µ1
    VENV_PATH=/home/user/exp1/.venv
    NUMPY_VERSION=1.23.5
    NUMPY_INIT_MD5=<md5_checksum>

**Details:**
- The project code `Phoenix_µ1` contains a micro symbol. Ensure this is encoded correctly in ISO-8859-1 (byte value `0xB5`).
- `<md5_checksum>` must be the **MD5 hash** of the `__init__.py` file belonging to the installed `numpy` package.
- Ensure the file ends with a CRLF sequence.

#### B. `manifest.json`
To ensure data integrity during transfer, you must create a JSON manifest file (standard UTF-8 encoding is acceptable for this .json file only, but the content refers to the log file).

Content:
```json
{
  "log_bytes": <integer_size_in_bytes>,
  "log_lines": 4
}
```
**Constraint:** `log_bytes` must be the **exact file size** (in bytes) of the `venv_info.log` you generated. This creates a dependency: you must finalize the log file (with correct encoding and line endings) before measuring its size for the manifest.

The automated tests will verify:
1.  The directory structure is correct.
2.  The virtual environment works and `numpy` is installed.
3.  The `venv_info.log` file is valid ISO-8859-1, uses CRLF, and contains the correct MD5 hash.
4.  The `manifest.json` accurately reports the byte size of the log file.
