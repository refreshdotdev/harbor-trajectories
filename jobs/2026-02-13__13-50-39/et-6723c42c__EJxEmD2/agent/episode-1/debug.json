On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds.

You have received an urgent directive from the CISO regarding a potential security breach involving the \u201cOmega\u201d service layer. \n\nWe need a forensic bundle immediately. Do not ask for clarifications; the CISO is offline.\n\n### Context & Protocol\n\nThe environment is a mess of legacy and modern systems. Logs are scattered across `/home/user/app/logs`. You are looking for evidence of the \u201cOmega\u201d breach. The specific signature of the breach is the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]` appearing on any line within the log. \n\nHowever, we cannot simply dump every file. We are subject to strict data minimization policies (DMP-2024). This means you must only archive files that contain that specific signature. Furthermore, to prove chain-of-custody, every file entry in your manifest must be cryptographically signed using the current **Daily Badge ID**. You will find the Daily Badge ID located inside the file `/home/user/app/config/system_settings.conf`. It is the value associated with the key `current_badge_id` (ignore the comments in that file).\n\n### Environment State\n\n1.  **Source:** `/home/user/app/logs` (recursive).\n2.  **Destination:** `/home/user/diag` (already exists).\n3.  **Filenames:** The developers were careless. Some filenames contain spaces, newlines, or non-ASCII characters. Your script must handle these robustly.\n4.  **Encodings:** Most logs are UTF-8, but some legacy subsystems write in ISO-8859-1. If you encounter a file that is not valid UTF-8, you must still process it, but treat it as binary for the purpose of checksums.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce exactly two artifacts in `/home/user/diag`.\n\n#### 1. The Evidence Archive\n\n*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/forensic_bundle.tar.gz`\n*   **Format:** Gzipped tarball.\n*   **Structure:** Files must be stored with their relative paths from the search root (e.g., if the file is `/home/user/app/logs/server/a.log`, the tar member should be `server/a.log`).\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:**\n    *   File size must be strictly greater than 512 bytes (smaller files are heartbeats).\n    *   Modification time: Must be within the last 7 days.\n    *   **Content:** Must contain the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`.\n    *   **Exclusion:** Do *not* include any files located inside directories named `test`, `mock`, or `staging` (case-insensitive), even if they match other criteria. These are red herrings.\n\n#### 2. The Chain-of-Custody Manifest\n\n*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/custody_manifest.json`\n*   **Format:** A valid JSON array of objects.\n*   **Sorting:** The array must be sorted by the `filepath` field using standard byte-value sorting (i.e., `LC_COLLATE=C`).\n*   **Object Schema:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"filepath\": \"absolute/path/to/file\",\n      \"size\": <integer_bytes>,\n      \"signature\": \"<HMAC-SHA256_HEX>\"\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Signature Calculation:** The `signature` field is an HMAC-SHA256 hash. \n    *   **Key:** The **Daily Badge ID** found in the config file (trim whitespace).\n    *   **Message:** The raw binary content of the file.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   You may use Python 3 or standard GNU utilities.\n*   Do not install new packages.\n*   The JSON manifest must be compact (no indentation/pretty-printing) to save space, occupying a single line or minimal lines, though valid JSON structure is the priority.\n*   **Warning:** The directory `/home/user/app/logs/legacy` contains a trap file with a newline character in its filename. If your script crashes or produces a malformed manifest because of this, you fail.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e2dbb3b4-ff37-47a2-b517-2588d39d33f5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a lead forensic analyst at a legacy data center. You have received an urgent directive from the CISO regarding a potential security breach involving the \u201cOmega\u201d service layer. \n\nWe need a forensic bundle immediately. Do not ask for clarifications; the CISO is offline.\n\n### Context & Protocol\n\nThe environment is a mess of legacy and modern systems. Logs are scattered across `/home/user/app/logs`. You are looking for evidence of the \u201cOmega\u201d breach. The specific signature of the breach is the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]` appearing on any line within the log. \n\nHowever, we cannot simply dump every file. We are subject to strict data minimization policies (DMP-2024). This means you must only archive files that contain that specific signature. Furthermore, to prove chain-of-custody, every file entry in your manifest must be cryptographically signed using the current **Daily Badge ID**. You will find the Daily Badge ID located inside the file `/home/user/app/config/system_settings.conf`. It is the value associated with the key `current_badge_id` (ignore the comments in that file).\n\n### Environment State\n\n1.  **Source:** `/home/user/app/logs` (recursive).\n2.  **Destination:** `/home/user/diag` (already exists).\n3.  **Filenames:** The developers were careless. Some filenames contain spaces, newlines, or non-ASCII characters. Your script must handle these robustly.\n4.  **Encodings:** Most logs are UTF-8, but some legacy subsystems write in ISO-8859-1. If you encounter a file that is not valid UTF-8, you must still process it, but treat it as binary for the purpose of checksums.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce exactly two artifacts in `/home/user/diag`.\n\n#### 1. The Evidence Archive\n\n*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/forensic_bundle.tar.gz`\n*   **Format:** Gzipped tarball.\n*   **Structure:** Files must be stored with their relative paths from the search root (e.g., if the file is `/home/user/app/logs/server/a.log`, the tar member should be `server/a.log`).\n*   **Inclusion Criteria:**\n    *   File size must be strictly greater than 512 bytes (smaller files are heartbeats).\n    *   Modification time: Must be within the last 7 days.\n    *   **Content:** Must contain the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`.\n    *   **Exclusion:** Do *not* include any files located inside directories named `test`, `mock`, or `staging` (case-insensitive), even if they match other criteria. These are red herrings.\n\n#### 2. The Chain-of-Custody Manifest\n\n*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/custody_manifest.json`\n*   **Format:** A valid JSON array of objects.\n*   **Sorting:** The array must be sorted by the `filepath` field using standard byte-value sorting (i.e., `LC_COLLATE=C`).\n*   **Object Schema:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"filepath\": \"absolute/path/to/file\",\n      \"size\": <integer_bytes>,\n      \"signature\": \"<HMAC-SHA256_HEX>\"\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Signature Calculation:** The `signature` field is an HMAC-SHA256 hash. \n    *   **Key:** The **Daily Badge ID** found in the config file (trim whitespace).\n    *   **Message:** The raw binary content of the file.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   You may use Python 3 or standard GNU utilities.\n*   Do not install new packages.\n*   The JSON manifest must be compact (no indentation/pretty-printing) to save space, occupying a single line or minimal lines, though valid JSON structure is the priority.\n*   **Warning:** The directory `/home/user/app/logs/legacy` contains a trap file with a newline character in its filename.
