The task requires me to find log files in `/home/user/app/logs` that contain `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`, are larger than 512 bytes, modified within the last 7 days, and not in `test`, `mock`, or `staging` directories. I then need to create a tar archive of these files and a signed JSON manifest. First, I need to obtain the Daily Badge ID from `/home/user/app/config/system_settings.conf`.",
  "plan": "First, I'll navigate to the `/home/user/app` directory and extract the Daily Badge ID from the config file. Then, I'll create a temporary directory in `/home/user/diag` to stage the forensic evidence. I'll use `find` with robust filename handling (null-delimited) to locate files meeting the criteria, then process them to create the tar archive and manifest. The manifest will be sorted by filepath and contain HMAC-SHA256 signatures using the Daily Badge ID as the key.",
