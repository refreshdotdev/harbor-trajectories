  "analysis": "The initial commands were executed, but there are several issues preventing successful task completion. The `fr_FR` directory was not fully cleaned as required (`.temp_config` remains). The `sed` commands for updating headers in `messages.po` used placeholder values (version '1.2.3' and timestamp '2023-10-27 14:30+0000') instead of the actual values read from `config/version.txt` ('2.5.1-beta') and generated by the `date` command ('2026-02-13 18:57+0000'). The `sed` command for inserting the 'Language' header and updating the 'Content-Type' charset was malformed and likely did not execute correctly. Consequently, the log entry was also appended with placeholder data, not the actual timestamp and version. The checksum generation and final directory listing show that `messages.po` exists, but `.temp_config` should not be there, and the contents of `messages.po` are likely incorrect. The task requires re-running the operations with correct data and commands.",
  "plan": "I will first re-run the command to ensure the `fr_FR` directory is completely empty. Then, I will re-copy the template. I will re-read the actual version and generate the actual timestamp. Using these actual values, I will carefully craft and execute the `sed` commands to correctly update `Project-Id-Version`, `PO-Revision-Date`, insert `Language: fr_FR`, and set the `Content-Type` charset to `UTF-8`. After these header updates, I will append the correct log entry to `update.log`. Finally, I will generate the checksum for the corrected `messages.po` file. Verification steps will confirm the directory contents and header correctness.",
