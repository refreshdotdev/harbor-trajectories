  "plan": "First I'll navigate to the localization directory. Then I'll clean the fr_FR directory by removing its deprecated files. Next I'll copy the template file to create the initial French translation. After that, I'll extract the version number and current timestamp to use for updating the PO file headers. I'll then modify the PO file headers to include the correct version, current UTC timestamp, language code, and UTF-8 charset. Finally, I'll append a log entry and generate the SHA-256 checksum for the new PO file.",
