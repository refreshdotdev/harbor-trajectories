  "analysis": "I am starting a new session in the root directory. The task requires me to perform a series of release preparation steps for the website project located at /home/user/projects/website. I need to create backups, generate a security token, update version numbers in package.json and config.xml, prepend to CHANGELOG.md, and generate a release manifest. The critical constraints include maintaining ISO-8859-1 encoding for config.xml, preserving CRLF line endings in CHANGELOG.md, and following the specific calculation for the release token.",
  "plan": "First I will navigate to the project directory and examine the current state of the files. Then I will create the backups directory and compress the original package.json. After that I will read the first line of CHANGELOG.md to generate the release token. I'll then proceed to update the version numbers and prepend the new changelog section. Finally, I'll generate the release manifest with the required hashes and token.",
