I see that my printf command got interpreted as a here-document instead of executing immediately. Let me complete the final verification steps.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The printf command didn't execute as expected. I need to complete the final verification to ensure all deliverables meet the protocol specifications before marking the task as complete.",
  "plan": "I will run the final verification commands to check: 1) The first two bytes of CHANGELOG.md to verify CRLF line endings, 2) The content and formatting of the release_manifest.json file, and 3) The file encoding of config.xml. This will complete all verification steps.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "echo \"=== Final Verification ===\"\n",

    {
