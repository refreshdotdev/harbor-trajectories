The installation appears to be running but got cut off. Let me wait for it to complete and then continue with the version updates.

```json

  "analysis": "The jq installation is still running. I need to wait for it to complete before proceeding with the version updates. The sed command for config.xml also appears to have been cut off.",
  "plan": "I will wait for the installation to complete, then retry the package.json and config.xml version updates. After verifying the updates, I'll proceed with Step D (Changelog Update).",
