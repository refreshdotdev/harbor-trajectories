Good! The changelog formatting has been fixed. Now I need to generate the final release manifest file.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The CHANGELOG.md formatting has been corrected. All the prerequisite files are updated and ready. I now need to complete Step E (Manifest Generation) by creating the release_manifest.json file with the calculated token, file hashes, and builder information.",
  "plan": "I will generate the SHA256 hashes for the updated package.json and config.xml files. Then I'll create the release_manifest.json file with the calculated release token, these hashes, and the builder name (from the BUILD_USER environment variable), using 4-space indentation as required.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "sha256sum package.json > /tmp/package_sha256.txt\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "sha256sum config.xml > /tmp/config_sha256.txt\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cat > release_manifest.json << 'EOF'\n{\n    \"release_token\": \"$(cat /tmp/release_token.txt)\",\n    \"package_sha256\": \"$(cut -d' ' -f1 /tmp/package_sha256.txt)\",\n    \"config_sha256\": \"$(cut -d' ' -f1 /tmp/config_sha256.txt)\",\n    \"builder\": \"${BUILD_USER}\"\n}\nEOF\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": false
}
```
