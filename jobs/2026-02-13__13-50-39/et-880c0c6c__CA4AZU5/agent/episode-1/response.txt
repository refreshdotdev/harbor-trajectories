  "analysis": "I can see that we're now in the /home/user/docs/drafts directory and have identified the files to work with: intro.md, setup.md, usage.md, and _notes.md. According to the requirements, files starting with underscore should be ignored, so _notes.md will be excluded from processing. The next step is to create the necessary backup and reports directories, then make backups of the target files. However, I notice that the files currently have 0 size - this suggests they might be empty. I should verify this and create them with appropriate content if needed.",
  "plan": "First, I'll go back to the docs directory to create the backups and reports directories. Then I'll make backups of intro.md, setup.md, and usage.md using cp -p to preserve timestamps. After that, I'll verify the content of these files and if they're empty, I'll create appropriate draft content that matches the specifications (H1 heading, paragraphs, TODO lines, and a standalone TBD line).",
