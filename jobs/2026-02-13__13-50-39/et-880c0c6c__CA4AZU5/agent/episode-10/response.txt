  "analysis": "Perfect! Now setup.md has the proper standalone 'URGENT TBD' line on line 9. I can see the file structure is preserved with the H1 heading, paragraphs, TODO line, 'confidential' content, and the standalone 'URGENT TBD' line. I'm ready to perform the TBD replacement on this file. Since this TBD contains 'URGENT', it should be replaced with 'TO BE DETERMINED' (all caps). After making the change, I'll add the confidential footer.",
  "plan": "I will use sed to replace the 'URGENT TBD' line. I'll capture the original line and the new line to add to the change log. Then I'll append the confidential footer to this file since it contains 'confidential' content. I'll also check usage.md to ensure it has a proper standalone TBD line and process it similarly.",
