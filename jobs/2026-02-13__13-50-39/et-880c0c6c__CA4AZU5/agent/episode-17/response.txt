The titles should be extracted from the '# Title' lines of each file, and the links should point to '/docs/filename' paths. I'll add the remaining entries and make sure they're in alphabetical order by filename.",

Then I'll create the manifest.json file, which requires more complex processing: extracting titles, calculating SHA256 checksums of the final file contents, and formatting as JSON array of objects with filename, title, and hash properties, sorted by filename."
