To properly test the text replacement and reporting functionality, I need to create meaningful content in these files that matches the specifications - each file should have a H1 heading, paragraphs, TODO lines, and a standalone TBD line. Some files should contain 'URGENT' for the TBD replacement variation.",
  "plan": "I will create appropriate content for each of the draft files (intro.md, setup.md, usage.md) that matches the required format. For variety, I'll make setup.md contain 'URGENT TBD' to test that replacement case, while the others will have regular standalone TBD lines. I'll also include some 'confidential' content in one file to test the footer injection requirement.",
