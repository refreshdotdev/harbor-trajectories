      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are assisting a senior technical-writer who is tidying up some draft\nMarkdown documentation stored in the directory\n\u201c/home/user/docs/drafts\u201d.\nThe writer would like several consolidated artefacts placed in\n\u201c/home/user/docs/reports\u201d and a backup of the originals in\n\u201c/home/user/docs/backups\u201d.\n\nInitial material you will find in \u201c/home/user/docs/drafts/\u201d:\n    \u2022 intro.md\n    \u2022 setup.md\n    \u2022 usage.md\n    \u2022 _notes.md (and possibly others)\n\nEach Markdown file contains:\n    \u2022 Exactly one top-level \u201cH1\u201d heading (a single \u201c# \u201d followed by the\n      title).\n    \u2022 Several free-form paragraphs.\n    \u2022 One or more lines containing the string \u201cTODO\u201d.\n    \u2022 Exactly one line containing the *stand-alone* word \u201cTBD\u201d.\n      (The word \u201cTBD\u201d never shares a line with any other \u201cTBD\u201d.)\n\nThe writer wants the following clean-up and reporting work:\n\n0.  Exclusion Rules\n    Ignore any file in the drafts directory whose name starts with an\n    underscore (`_`). These files must not be modified, backed up, or\n    referenced in any report.\n\n1.  Backups\n    Before modifying any file, create a copy in \u201c/home/user/docs/backups\u201d.\n    \u2022 The backup filename must be the original filename with \u201c.bak\u201d appended\n      (e.g., \u201cintro.md.bak\u201d).\n    \u2022 You must preserve the original file\u2019s timestamps and permissions\n      (e.g., use `cp -p`).\n\n2.  Text Replacement\n    Modify the valid draft files in place:\n    \u2022 If a line containing the stand-alone word \u201cTBD\u201d also contains the\n      string \u201cURGENT\u201d (case-sensitive), replace \u201cTBD\u201d with\n      \u201cTO BE DETERMINED\u201d (all caps).\n    \u2022 Otherwise, replace the stand-alone word \u201cTBD\u201d with \u201cTo Be Determined\u201d.\n    \u2022 No other words on the line should be changed.\n\n3.  Footer Injection\n    Check the content of each file (before or during processing):\n    \u2022 If the file contains the word \u201cconfidential\u201d (case-insensitive) anywhere,\n      append exactly two newline characters followed by the line:\n      `> This document is confidential.`\n      to the end of the file.\n\n4.  TODO summary file\n    Create \u201c/home/user/docs/reports/todo_summary.txt\u201d:\n        TODO Summary Report\n\n        <filename>: <count>\n        <filename>: <count>\n        ...\n    Requirements:\n        \u2022 List every processed filename, sorted alphabetically.\n        \u2022 <count> is the number of lines containing \u201cTODO\u201d in the final file.\n\n5.  Table-of-Contents (TOC) file\n    Create \u201c/home/user/docs/reports/toc.md\u201d:\n        - [<H1 Title>](/docs/<filename>)\n        ...\n    Requirements:\n        \u2022 One line per processed file, sorted alphabetically by filename.\n\n6.  Change log\n    Produce \u201c/home/user/docs/reports/change_log.log\u201d:\n        Change Log\n        YYYY-MM-DD <filename>: \"<original line>\" -> \"<new line>\"\n        ...\n    Requirements:\n        \u2022 Document the single \u201cTBD\u201d replacement for each processed file.\n        \u2022 Sorted alphabetically by filename.\n        \u2022 Preserve exact spacing/content of original and new lines.\n\n7.  Manifest JSON\n    Create \u201c/home/user/docs/reports/manifest.json\u201d.\n    This file must contain a JSON array of objects, one for each processed\n    file, sorted by filename. Each object must have:\n        \u2022 \"filename\": The base filename (e.g., \"intro.md\")\n        \u2022 \"title\": The H1 title extracted from the file.\n        \u2022 \"hash\": The SHA256 checksum of the *final* file content.\n\nDirectory constraints & permissions:\n    \u2022 Create directories if they do not exist.\n    \u2022 All created files/directories must be writable by the current user.\n    \u2022 Report files must be world-readable.\n\nVerification hints:\n    \u2022 Checksums in manifest.json must match the final file state on disk.\n    \u2022 Backups must match the state of files *before* any modification.\n    \u2022 Files starting with `_` must be completely ignored.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@2980c8c1-9597-49f5-bfb0-7b86dcb06421:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
