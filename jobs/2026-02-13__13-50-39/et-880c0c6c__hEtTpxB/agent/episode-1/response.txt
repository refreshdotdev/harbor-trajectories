  "analysis": "I've successfully navigated to the /home/user/docs directory and created the reports and backups directories. The ls command shows there are 4 Markdown files in drafts/: intro.md, setup.md, usage.md, and _notes.md. According to the requirements, I should ignore files starting with an underscore, so _notes.md will be excluded from processing.",
  "plan": "I will now process each valid draft file (intro.md, setup.md, usage.md) by: 1) Creating backups, 2) Extracting the H1 title for manifest and TOC, 3) Performing text replacements (TBD -> TO BE DETERMINED or To Be Determined based on URGENT presence), 4) Injecting confidential footer if needed, 5) Collecting TODO counts, and 6) Tracking changes for the change log.",
