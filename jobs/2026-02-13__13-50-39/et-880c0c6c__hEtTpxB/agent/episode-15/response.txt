The grep command for extracting the H1 title produced no output, indicating that usage.md either doesn't contain an H1 heading or is empty. This makes three consecutive empty files, which is highly unusual given the task description. I will proceed to check for TBD replacements and confidential content, expecting similar empty results.",
  "plan": "I will now check usage.md for stand-alone TBD instances and confidential content. After these checks, I will count the TODOs. Since all files appear to be empty, I will then proceed to generate the report files with the available information, handling missing content appropriately in each report.",
