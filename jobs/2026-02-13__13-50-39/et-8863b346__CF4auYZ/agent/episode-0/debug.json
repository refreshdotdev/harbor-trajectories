Your task is to generate a strict migration manifest for the audit team. This is not a standard Linux task; you are bridging a gap between an old Windows-based mainframe export and a legacy auditing system.\n\n### The Environment\n\nThe environment contains several files, but you must be careful to use the correct ones.\n\n1.  **Source Inventory:** The location of the authoritative inventory file is stored in the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`. \n    *   *Warning:* Do not use any other CSV files you might find in the directory tree; they are stale exports.\n    *   *Context:* This file comes from a Windows mainframe. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.\n    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.\n\n2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.\n\n#### 1. The Migration Plan (`migration_plan.tsv`)\n\nYou must generate a Tab-Separated Values file. \n\n**Content Requirements:**\n*   **Columns:** Exactly two columns: `ServiceName` and `TargetFQDN`.\n*   **Filtering:** \n    *   Ignore comment lines (lines starting with `#` after decoding).\n    *   The source CSV has a column named `Status`. You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.\n    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.\n    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.\n*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.\n\n**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**\n*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.\n*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).\n\n#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nInstead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source_file\": \"<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>\",\n  \"record_count\": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,\n  \"output_md5\": \"<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.\n\n#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)\n\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.\n*   It must contain exactly one line.\n*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.\n*   Example: `452 bytes generated`\n\n### Summary of Constraints\n*   Do not modify the source files.\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).\n*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@7580c8f0-e7c8-4065-8c8c-491704ad27c6:/home/user/cloud#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The task requires me to process a UTF-16LE encoded inventory file (path stored in `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`), append a domain suffix from `/home/user/cloud/.config` to server names, and generate three specific output files: `migration_plan.tsv`, `manifest.json`, and `audit.log` in a new `output` directory. I need to be careful about data filtering, transformations, sorting, and strict file encoding (ISO-8859-1) and line ending (CRLF) requirements for the TSV file.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"1. First, I will check the current working directory and list its contents. 2. I will create the required output directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`. 3. I will then examine the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` to know the path of the source inventory file. 4. Next, I'll read the domain suffix from the hidden file `/home/user/cloud/.config`. 5. With these pieces of information, I will construct a Python script that performs all the necessary data processing, filtering, transformations, and file generation according to the specification. This includes handling the UTF-16LE input with BOM, removing Zero Width Spaces, applying filters, lowercasing, appending the domain, sorting, and ensuring the TSV output is ISO-8859-1 encoded with CRLF line endings. 6. The Python script will also generate the `manifest.json` (including an MD5 hash of the final TSV) and `audit.log` files. 7. Finally, I will execute this Python script.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"pwd\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"ls -la\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/cloud/output\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"echo \\\\\\\"Source inventory file: $LEGACY_INVENTORY\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat /home/user/cloud/.config\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > /tmp/migration_script.py << 'EOF'\\\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\\\\nimport os\\\\nimport sys\\\\nimport csv\\\\nimport json\\\\nimport io\\\\nimport hashlib\\\\nimport re\\\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\\\n\\\\n# --- Configuration ---\\\\nSOURCE_INVENTORY = os.environ.get('LEGACY_INVENTORY')\\\\nCONFIG_FILE = '/home/user/cloud/.config'\\\\nOUTPUT_DIR = '/home/user/cloud/output'\\\\nDOMAIN_SUFFIX = None\\\\nMIGRATION_PLAN_FILE = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'migration_plan.tsv')\\\\nMANIFEST_FILE = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'manifest.json')\\\\nAUDIT_LOG_FILE = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'audit.log')\\\\n\\\\nclass CRLFWriter:\\\\n    \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"A CSV writer that forces CRLF line endings and encodes to ISO-8859-1.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    def __init__(self, f):\\\\n        self.writer = csv.writer(f, dialect='excel', lineterminator='\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n')\\\\n\\\\n    def writerow(self, row):\\\\n        self.writer.writerow(row)\\\\n\\\\n    def writerows(self, rows):\\\\n        for r in rows:\\\\n            self.writerow(r)\\\\n\\\\ndef remove_zwsp(text):\\\\n    \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Remove Zero Width Spaces (U+200B).\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    if text:\\\\n        return text.replace('\\\\\\\\u200b', '')\\\\n    return text\\\\n\\\\ndef main():\\\\n    if not os.path.exists(OUTPUT_DIR):\\\\n        os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)\\\\n\\\\n    # Read domain suffix\\\\n    try:\\\\n        with open(CONFIG_FILE, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\\\\n            domain_suffix_content = f.read().strip()\\\\n            if domain_suffix_content:\\\\n                DOMAIN_SUFFIX = domain_suffix_content\\\\n                print(f\\\\\\\"Domain suffix read: {DOMAIN_SUFFIX}\\\\\\\")\\\\n            else:\\\\n                print(f\\\\\\\"Warning: Domain suffix file {CONFIG_FILE} is empty or not readable.
