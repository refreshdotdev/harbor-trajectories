You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are the lead engineer for the "Phoenix" Legacy Migration Project. Your task is to generate a strict migration manifest for the audit team. This is not a standard Linux task; you are bridging a gap between an old Windows-based mainframe export and a legacy auditing system.

### The Environment

The environment contains several files, but you must be careful to use the correct ones.

1.  **Source Inventory:** The location of the authoritative inventory file is stored in the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`. 
    *   *Warning:* Do not use any other CSV files you might find in the directory tree; they are stale exports.
    *   *Context:* This file comes from a Windows mainframe. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.
    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.

2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).

### Deliverables

You must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.

#### 1. The Migration Plan (`migration_plan.tsv`)

You must generate a Tab-Separated Values file. 

**Content Requirements:**
*   **Columns:** Exactly two columns: `ServiceName` and `TargetFQDN`.
*   **Filtering:** 
    *   Ignore comment lines (lines starting with `#` after decoding).
    *   The source CSV has a column named `Status`. You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.
    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.
*   **Transformation:**
    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.
    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.
*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.

**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**
*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.
*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\r\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.
*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).

#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)

Instead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "source_file": "<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>",
  "record_count": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,
  "output_md5": "<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>"
}
```

*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.

#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)

Create a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.
*   It must contain exactly one line.
*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.
*   Example: `452 bytes generated`

### Summary of Constraints
*   Do not modify the source files.
*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).
*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.
