      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are the lead engineer for the \"Phoenix\" Legacy Migration Project. Your task is to generate a strict migration manifest for the audit team. This is not a standard Linux task; you are bridging a gap between an old Windows-based mainframe export and a legacy auditing system.\n\n### The Environment\n\nThe environment contains several files, but you must be careful to use the correct ones.\n\n1.  **Source Inventory:** The location of the authoritative inventory file is stored in the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`. \n    *   *Warning:* Do not use any other CSV files you might find in the directory tree; they are stale exports.\n    *   *Context:* This file comes from a Windows mainframe. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.\n    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.\n\n2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.\n\n#### 1. The Migration Plan (`migration_plan.tsv`)\n\nYou must generate a Tab-Separated Values file. \n\n**Content Requirements:**\n*   **Columns:** Exactly two columns: `ServiceName` and `TargetFQDN`.\n*   **Filtering:** \n    *   Ignore comment lines (lines starting with `#` after decoding).\n    *   The source CSV has a column named `Status`. You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.\n    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.\n    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.\n*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.\n\n**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**\n*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.\n*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).\n\n#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nInstead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source_file\": \"<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>\",\n  \"record_count\": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,\n  \"output_md5\": \"<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.\n\n#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)\n\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.\n*   It must contain exactly one line.\n*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.\n*   Example: `452 bytes generated`\n\n### Summary of Constraints\n*   Do not modify the source files.\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).\n*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@7580c8f0-e7c8-4065-8c8c-491704ad27c6:/home/user/cloud#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "message": "Analysis: I am starting in the `/home/user/cloud` directory. The task requires me to process a UTF-16LE encoded inventory file (path stored in `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`), append a domain suffix from `/home/user/cloud/.config` to server names, and generate three specific output files: `migration_plan.tsv`, `manifest.json`, and `audit.log` in a new `output` directory. I need to be careful about data filtering, transformations, sorting, and strict file encoding (ISO-8859-1) and line ending (CRLF) requirements for the TSV file.\nPlan: 1. First, I will check the current working directory and list its contents. 2. I will create the required output directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`. 3. I will then examine the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` to know the path of the source inventory file. 4. Next, I'll read the domain suffix from the hidden file `/home/user/cloud/.config`. 5. With these pieces of information, I will construct a Python script that performs all the necessary data processing, filtering, transformations, and file generation according to the specification. This includes handling the UTF-16LE input with BOM, removing Zero Width Spaces, applying filters, lowercasing, appending the domain, sorting, and ensuring the TSV output is ISO-8859-1 encoded with CRLF line endings. 6. The Python script will also generate the `manifest.json` (including an MD5 hash of the final TSV) and `audit.log` files. 7. Finally, I will execute this Python script.",

The issue was related to how the prompt characters (e.g., `r>`, `n>`) were handled when writing the script content. The task is to generate a migration manifest, and this requires a corrected script.\nPlan: I will re-create the Python script `/tmp/migration_script.py` carefully, ensuring the heredoc syntax is correct and the script contents are accurate. After creating the script, I will execute it. Finally, I will list the contents of the output directory to confirm the deliverables have been generated.",
