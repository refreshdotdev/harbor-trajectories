Your task is to generate a strict migration manifest for the audit team. This is not a standard Linux task; you are bridging a gap between an old Windows-based mainframe export and a legacy auditing system.\n\n### The Environment\n\nThe environment contains several files, but you must be careful to use the correct ones.\n\n1.  **Source Inventory:** The location of the authoritative inventory file is stored in the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`. \n    *   *Warning:* Do not use any other CSV files you might find in the directory tree; they are stale exports.\n    *   *Context:* This file comes from a Windows mainframe. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.\n    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.\n\n2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.\n\n#### 1. The Migration Plan (`migration_plan.tsv`)\n\nYou must generate a Tab-Separated Values file. \n\n**Content Requirements:**\n*   **Columns:** Exactly two columns: `ServiceName` and `TargetFQDN`.\n*   **Filtering:** \n    *   Ignore comment lines (lines starting with `#` after decoding).\n    *   The source CSV has a column named `Status`. You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.\n    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.\n    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.\n*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.\n\n**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**\n*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.\n*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).\n\n#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nInstead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source_file\": \"<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>\",\n  \"record_count\": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,\n  \"output_md5\": \"<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.\n\n#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)\n\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.\n*   It must contain exactly one line.\n*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.\n*   Example: `452 bytes generated`\n\n### Summary of Constraints\n*   Do not modify the source files.\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).\n*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@64f3511b-3154-4867-a464-dbff3c8f6363:/home/user/cloud#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I have not yet started working on the Phoenix Legacy Migration Project. The environment variables and specific file constraints (like `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` and the hidden `.config` file) are known from the task description, but I need to verify their actual contents and existence. The output directory `/home/user/cloud/output` also needs to be created. My task is to generate three specific deliverables: `migration_plan.tsv`, `manifest.json`, and `audit.log`, adhering to very strict formatting and content requirements.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"My first step is to set up the necessary directory structure by creating `/home/user/cloud/output`. Then, I need to investigate and gather crucial information: I'll check the content of the `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` environment variable to know the source file, and I'll read the domain suffix from the hidden `.config` file. I also need to examine the source CSV file's structure (column names, data types) to understand how to process it. After this initial reconnaissance, I'll proceed to develop a script (likely Python) to process the source file, transform the data according to the requirements, and generate the output files with the specified encodings and line endings.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/cloud/output\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"echo \\\\\\\"Source Inventory File: $LEGACY_INVENTORY\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat /home/user/cloud/.config\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"head -5 \\\\\\\"$LEGACY_INVENTORY\\\\\\\" | od -c\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.5\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\\n```\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1588,\"completion_tokens\":417,\"total_tokens\":2005,\"cost\":0.00037324,\"is_byok\":false,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":0.00037324,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.00020644,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0001668},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0}}}",
