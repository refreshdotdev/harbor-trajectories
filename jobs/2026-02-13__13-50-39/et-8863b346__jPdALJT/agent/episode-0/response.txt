  "analysis": "The current terminal state shows I am in the `/home/user/cloud` directory as the root user. I have not yet started working on the Phoenix Legacy Migration Project. The environment variables and specific file constraints (like `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` and the hidden `.config` file) are known from the task description, but I need to verify their actual contents and existence. The output directory `/home/user/cloud/output` also needs to be created. My task is to generate three specific deliverables: `migration_plan.tsv`, `manifest.json`, and `audit.log`, adhering to very strict formatting and content requirements.",
  "plan": "My first step is to set up the necessary directory structure by creating `/home/user/cloud/output`. Then, I need to investigate and gather crucial information: I'll check the content of the `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` environment variable to know the source file, and I'll read the domain suffix from the hidden `.config` file. I also need to examine the source CSV file's structure (column names, data types) to understand how to process it. After this initial reconnaissance, I'll proceed to develop a script (likely Python) to process the source file, transform the data according to the requirements, and generate the output files with the specified encodings and line endings.",
