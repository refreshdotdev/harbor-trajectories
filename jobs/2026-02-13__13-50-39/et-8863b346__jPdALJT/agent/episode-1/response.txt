  "analysis": "My initial reconnaissance commands have run. The output directory `/home/user/cloud/output` was successfully created. The `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` environment variable correctly points to `/home/user/cloud/legacy/mainframe_export.csv`, and the domain suffix from `/home/user/cloud/.config` is `.internal.corp`. However, the `head` command revealed a critical issue: the source inventory file `/home/user/cloud/legacy/mainframe_export.csv` does not exist. This is a blocker, as the task heavily relies on processing this file. I need to investigate this discrepancy.",
  "plan": "My immediate priority is to understand why the source file, indicated by `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`, is missing. I will first verify the path of `$LEGACY_INVENTORY` again. Then, I will check if the `/home/user/cloud/legacy/` directory exists and list its contents. This will help determine if the path is incorrect, the file has a different name, or if there's another issue. Once the source data situation is clarified, I can proceed with the migration plan. If the file is genuinely missing, the task cannot be completed as specified.",
