Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are helping a developer clean-up and reorganize a small project\u2019s raw datasets. \n    The workspace already contains three raw data files (two CSVs and one messy text file) and a random notes file. \n    These need to be merged, cleaned, summarized, and archived. \n\n    Make sure every requested artefact is created exactly as specified, including directory names, file names,\n    file contents and *precise* JSON and CSV formatting (the automated grader will compare them byte-for-byte).\n\n    Initial state (already present when you start):\n    \u2022 /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/alpha.csv\n    \u2022 /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/beta.csv\n    \u2022 /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/gamma.csv (contains semicolon delimiters, comments, and whitespace)\n    \u2022 /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/notes.txt\n\n    Your tasks are as follows:\n\n    1. Create the directory /home/user/dev_project/report\n       (create parents first if they do not exist).\n\n    2. Produce /home/user/dev_project/report/combined.csv that meets *all* of the following requirements:\n       \u2022 It must contain **one** header line, exactly: `id,name,score`\n       \u2022 It must merge valid data from `alpha.csv`, `beta.csv`, and `gamma.csv`.\n       \u2022 Data cleaning rules:\n         - Ignore any lines starting with `#`.\n         - Normalize all delimiters to commas.\n         - Trim any leading/trailing whitespace from names and scores.\n       \u2022 **Sorting**: The final rows must be sorted by `id` in ascending numerical order.\n       \u2022 Lines must be separated by a single Unix newline (`\\n`).\n       \u2022 There must be *no* blank line at the end of the file.\n\n       Expected final byte-for-byte contents of combined.csv:\n       ```\n       id,name,score\n       1,Alice,88\n       2,Bob,92\n       3,Charlie,67\n       4,Denise,75\n       5,Evan,83\n       6,Faith,91\n       7,George,80\n       8,Hannah,90\n       ```\n\n    3. Create /home/user/dev_project/report/summary.json which must be a\n       single-line, minified JSON document (no extra whitespace except the one\n       blank space after each colon). The required contents are:\n\n       {\"total_rows\":8,\"average_score\":83.25,\"max_score\":92,\"min_score\":67,\"top_performer\":{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Bob\",\"score\":92},\"data_sha256\":\"<SHA256_HASH>\"}\n\n       Notes:\n       \u2022 `data_sha256` must be the lowercase SHA256 hex digest of the final `combined.csv` file content.\n       \u2022 `average_score` must be rounded to exactly two decimal places.\n       \u2022 The object members must appear in the exact order shown above.\n       \u2022 summary.json must end with a Unix newline character.\n\n    4. Archive the source files:\n       \u2022 Move `alpha.csv`, `beta.csv`, and `gamma.csv` into `/home/user/dev_project/archive/raw_data/`.\n       \u2022 Move `notes.txt` into `/home/user/dev_project/archive/skipped/`.\n       \u2022 Ensure the original `raw_data` directory is empty.\n\n    5. Generate a plain-text processing log at\n       /home/user/dev_project/report/process.log. The file must contain\n       exactly three lines (each terminated with `\\n`):\n\n       2023-01-01 10:00:00 Combined 3 data files. Final size: <BYTES> bytes\n       2023-01-01 10:00:01 Generated summary.json with checksum\n       2023-01-01 10:00:02 Archived source files\n\n       Replace `<BYTES>` with the actual byte count of your generated `combined.csv`.\n       Do **not** append any additional output or blank lines.\n\n    Verification hints:\n    \u2022 The grader will check that combined.csv, summary.json and process.log\n      exist at the exact paths and match the contents shown above *byte for byte*.\n    \u2022 Ensure your SHA256 calculation is performed on the final file content (with no trailing newline).\n\n    You do not have root privileges; stay within /home/user.\n    Show any intermediate console output you find helpful.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@54fec384-9ea0-4921-950d-bdaf1fd867d5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
