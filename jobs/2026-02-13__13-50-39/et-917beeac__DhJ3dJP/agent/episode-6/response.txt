  "analysis": "The CSV files were processed but not as expected. The TSV files were created with .csv.tsv extensions instead of just .tsv. Also, the row counts in the manifest appear incorrect, and the staging directory is empty because the tarball couldn't be created properly. I need to fix the TSV file naming and improve the CSV processing.",
  "plan": "I will modify the script to generate proper .tsv files (without the .csv extension) and ensure correct TSV conversion. I'll also fix the row counting and test the archival process again. Then I'll verify the final artifacts meet all requirements.",
