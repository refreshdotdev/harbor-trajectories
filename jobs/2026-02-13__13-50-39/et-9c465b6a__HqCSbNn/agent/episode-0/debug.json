The task involves fixing a data ingestion script that processes click-stream data. The previous attempt failed because it ignored several legacy system constraints documented in the company's internal wiki (reproduced below).\n\n## Context\n\nThe raw data is exported daily from an old Windows-based SQL server to `/home/user/data/raw/user_events.tsv`. This file is tab-separated but is known to be \"noisy\" due to the export process. \n\nYour goal is to transform this data into a clean CSV format for the mainframe ingestion system. \n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Configuration & Discovery\n\nUnlike modern pipelines, the output format for this task is dynamic. You must locate the output schema definition file stored in `/opt/settings/`. It is a YAML file named `schema_v2.yaml`. \n\n*   You must read this YAML file to determine the **exact column order** and **column headers** required for the output CSV.\n*   The output CSV header line must match the keys in the YAML file exactly (including casing).\n\n### 2. Input Processing\n\nRead the raw file at `/home/user/data/raw/user_events.tsv`.\n*   **Warning:** The file is generated by a legacy Windows tool. It may contain artifacts (like BOMs) or non-standard line endings that standard Linux tools might stumble over. You must handle this gracefully.\n*   **Filtering:**\n    *   Discard any rows where the `timestamp` is missing or empty.\n    *   Discard any rows where `event_type` is \"test\" or \"debug\" (case-insensitive).\n    *   **User Validity:** A user is considered \"valid\" ONLY if they have performed at least 3 distinct events (regardless of type). Discard all data for users who have fewer than 3 events in the file.\n\n### 3. Transformation Logic\n\n*   **Deduplication:** The mainframe cannot handle duplicate records. A record is defined as a tuple of `(user_id, event_type, timestamp)`. Keep only the *last* occurrence of any duplicate tuple (based on file order).\n*   **VIP Status:** You need to calculate a `vip_status` column (which corresponds to one of the fields in the YAML schema).\n    *   Check `/home/user/data/ref/vip_users.list`. This file contains a list of User IDs, one per line.\n    *   If a `user_id` appears in this list, their `vip_status` is `TRUE`. Otherwise, it is `FALSE`.\n    *   *Note:* The VIP list is manually edited by sales staff and may contain accidental whitespace.\n\n### 4. Output Specifications (Critical)\n\nThe mainframe is very strict. If these constraints are not met, the job will fail upstream.\n\n*   **File Path:** Save the result to `/home/user/data/processed/clean_ingest.csv`.\n*   **Encoding:** The output file **MUST** be encoded in `ISO-8859-1` (Latin-1).\n*   **Line Endings:** The output file **MUST** use Windows-style line endings (`\\r\\n`), including the header row.\n*   **Sorting:** Sort the data by `vip_status` (TRUE first), then by `timestamp` (newest first).\n\n### 5. Manifest Generation\n\nOnce the CSV is fully written to disk, you must generate a manifest file at `/home/user/data/processed/manifest.txt`.\n\nThis file must contain exactly one line with the following format:\n`CSV_SHA256:<hash>|ROWS:<N>|BYTES:<B>`\n\n*   `<hash>`: The SHA-256 checksum of the final `clean_ingest.csv` file.\n*   `<N>`: The number of data rows (excluding header).\n*   `<B>`: The exact file size in bytes of the `clean_ingest.csv` on disk.\n\n## Environment Notes\n\n*   The `/home/user/data/processed` directory might not exist; create it if needed.\n*   Do not modify the raw input files.\n*   Python 3 is installed. You are encouraged to use it.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c91a5f1c-97b1-49b7-83ed-7852319828fa:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
