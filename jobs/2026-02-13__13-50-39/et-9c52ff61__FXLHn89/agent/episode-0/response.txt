The current terminal state shows I am root in a container, but the task specifies I should operate as a standard user in `/home/user/server_logs/`. I need to first navigate to the correct directory and examine the available input files. The task requires careful handling of character encodings, line endings, and file formats using specific tools like awk, sed, iconv, and unix2dos.",
  "plan": "First, I will navigate to the specified working directory and verify its contents. Then I'll create the required summary output directory. After that, I will process each input file according to the detailed specifications, paying close attention to the formatting and encoding requirements for each output artifact. Finally, I will generate the maintenance audit log and integrity manifest.",
