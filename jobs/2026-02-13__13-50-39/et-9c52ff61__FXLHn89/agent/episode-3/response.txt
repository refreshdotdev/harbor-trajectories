  "analysis": "I have confirmed that access.log and error.log are empty, but usage.csv contains some data starting with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) - EF BB BF. This matches the task description which mentions the CSV comes from Excel and may contain a BOM. However, without actual content in access.log and error.log, I cannot generate the access summary or error report. The task requires processing all three files.",
  "plan": "Since the environment appears to be missing the actual log data for access.log and error.log, I cannot complete the full task as specified. I will proceed with processing the available usage.csv file to generate the CPU utilization CSV report, as this is the only one with data. For the other reports that depend on missing data, I will create empty placeholder files with appropriate headers or structures where possible.",
