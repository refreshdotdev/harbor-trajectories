You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Kubernetes Manifest Render Pipeline (Legacy/Win/Sec)

You are the lead DevSecOps engineer responsible for the "Titan" deployment pipeline. This pipeline generates Kubernetes manifests for a hybrid environment involving legacy mainframes and Windows-based Kubernetes nodes.

All configuration and templates are located in `/home/user/k8s`.

## 1. Configuration Protocol

The configuration is strictly hierarchical. You must load the base configuration from `/home/user/k8s/config/base.env`, and then override any keys found in `/home/user/k8s/config/overlay.env`. 

**Warning**: The `overlay.env` file is generated by a Windows-based developer toolchain. It may contain artifacts typical of that environment (e.g., Byte Order Marks) which must be handled cleanly so they do not corrupt the variable names or values. 

There is also a `defaults.env` file in the config directory. This is a deprecated artifact from a previous version of the pipeline. **Do not use it.** Reading values from this file constitutes a security violation.

## 2. Data Transformation Rules

Before rendering, specific variables require cryptographic transformation:

*   **API_KEY**: The raw value derived from the merged configuration must be **reversed** (e.g., "abc" -> "cba") and *then* **Base64 encoded**. This obfuscated value maps to the placeholder `${API_KEY_SPECIAL}`.
*   **TEMPLATE_HASH**: You must calculate the SHA256 checksum of the source template file (`/home/user/k8s/templates/deployment.yaml.tpl`). Use the first 8 characters of the hex digest. Maps to `${TEMPLATE_HASH}`.

## 3. The Pre-flight Checkpoint

To ensure auditability before manifest generation, you must create a JSON audit file at `/home/user/k8s/audit/preflight.json`. This file is consumed by an automated policy checker.

The JSON must be **compact** (no newlines or extra whitespace outside of strings) and contain exactly these keys:
*   `"app_name"`: The final value of APP_NAME.
*   `"environment"`: The final value of ENVIRONMENT.
*   `"api_key_processed"`: The transformed API key.
*   `"template_hash"`: The 8-character template hash.

## 4. Manifest Rendering (Windows Cluster)

Generate the final Kubernetes manifest at `/home/user/k8s/rendered/deployment.yaml` by applying the variables to the template.

**Critical Constraint**: The target Kubernetes cluster runs on Windows Server Core 2019. The Kubernetes parser on these nodes requires **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)** line endings for all YAML files. Standard Linux LF endings will cause the deployment to fail silently.

The file content must be UTF-8 encoded.

## 5. Legacy Logging (Mainframe Aggregator)

Finally, generate a deployment log at `/home/user/k8s/logs/render.log`. 

**Critical Constraint**: This log is ingested by a legacy mainframe system that **does not support UTF-8**. The file **must be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. If the file contains UTF-8 byte sequences for special characters, the mainframe ingestor will crash.

The log must contain the following lines in order:

```text
APP_NAME=<value>
ENVIRONMENT=<value>
PREFLIGHT_HASH=<MD5_hash_of_the_preflight.json_file>
MANIFEST_HASH=<SHA256_hash_of_the_rendered_deployment.yaml>
```

(Note: The `ENVIRONMENT` variable in the overlay file intentionally contains a special character '§' to test the encoding capabilities of the logging system. Ensure this character is correctly encoded in Latin-1, i.e., a single byte `0xA7`, not the UTF-8 two-byte sequence.)

## Summary of Deliverables

1.  `/home/user/k8s/audit/preflight.json` (Compact JSON)
2.  `/home/user/k8s/rendered/deployment.yaml` (UTF-8, **CRLF** endings)
3.  `/home/user/k8s/logs/render.log` (**ISO-8859-1** encoded)

Ensure no other files are created or modified.
