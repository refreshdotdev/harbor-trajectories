  "analysis": "The deployment log file has been created successfully. However, I've encountered a critical issue: the special character '§' in the ENVIRONMENT variable has been converted to a regular ASCII character '1' (producing 'prod_1') during the conversion from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1. This indicates that either the character encoding conversion did not handle the '§' character correctly or that the character was not properly represented in the original text. The log file has a size of 168 bytes.",
  "plan": "I need to ensure the special character '§' (section sign) is correctly represented in Latin-1 encoding. In ISO-8859-1, the section sign corresponds to the byte 0xA7. I will recreate the log file content with explicit handling of this character. After creating the corrected log with proper encoding, I'll proceed to the final verification of all deliverables.",
