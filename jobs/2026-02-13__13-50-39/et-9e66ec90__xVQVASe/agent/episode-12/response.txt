  "analysis": "There was an issue with the character encoding conversion. The `iconv` command reported an \"illegal input sequence at position 38\" when trying to convert the log file to ISO-8859-1. This suggests that the way I'm trying to insert the special character '§' (represented as `\\xA7`) is not working correctly in the echo command. The resulting log file content appears to be truncated or corrupted.",
  "plan": "I will try a different approach to create the log file with the special character properly encoded. Instead of using echo with escape sequences, I'll use printf which provides better control over character encoding. I'll ensure the '§' character is correctly represented and that the conversion to ISO-8859-1 proceeds without errors. After this, I'll do a final verification of all deliverables.",
