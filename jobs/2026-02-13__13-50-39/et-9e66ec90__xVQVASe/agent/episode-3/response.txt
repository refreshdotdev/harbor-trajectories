  "analysis": "The configuration files have been processed. The Byte Order Mark was successfully removed from `overlay.env`. However, the `APP_NAME` variable appears to be empty after parsing, while `ENVIRONMENT` correctly contains `prod_§1` (showing the special character §) and `API_KEY` is `secret_agent_99`. This indicates that the `tail -c +5` command removed more than intended from the beginning of the file. I need to extract the variables more accurately, particularly ensuring `APP_NAME` is captured correctly.",
  "plan": "I will re-process the `overlay.env` file to extract the variables more reliably. Instead of using `tail`, I'll use a more precise method to remove only the BOM and then parse each variable individually. I'll handle the special character in `ENVIRONMENT` appropriately for later encoding requirements. After setting all variables correctly, I'll proceed to the cryptographic transformation of the API key.",
