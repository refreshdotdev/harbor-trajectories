  "plan": "For the manifest rendering, I need to process the template file located at `templates/deployment.yaml.tpl`. Since this file appears to be empty (given its SHA256 hash is e3b0c442), the rendered manifest will essentially be the template with placeholders replaced by the configured values. I'll create the rendered manifest at `/home/user/k8s/rendered/deployment.yaml` with UTF-8 encoding and CRLF line endings as required for the Windows Server Core 2019 Kubernetes cluster.",
