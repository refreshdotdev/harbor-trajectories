  "analysis": "I am starting in the root user's home directory. I need to process solver outputs from `/home/user/api_test/responses`, use system configuration from `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`, and produce outputs in `/home/user/api_test/processed` and `/home/user/api_test`. The first step is to examine the system configuration file to understand the variable threshold and tie-breaker logic.",
  "plan": "1. Read the system-wide configuration file `/opt/solver/settings.yaml` to get `variable_threshold` and `tie_breaker` values. 2. Navigate to the directory containing the solver responses. 3. Scan for `.json` and `.log` files, then parse their content. For `.log` files, I'll need to handle ISO-8859-1 encoding and strip C-style comments. 4. Filter runs where the `status` field is not 'optimal' (case-insensitive). 5. Generate the audit manifest `manifest.csv` with `id,objective,timestamp` (CRLF line endings, no header, sorted by timestamp descending). 6. Select the winning run based on lowest objective value, using the tie-breaker rule from the config. 7. Generate the final report `optimization_report.log` with the required fields.",
