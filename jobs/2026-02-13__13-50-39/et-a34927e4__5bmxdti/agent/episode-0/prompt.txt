You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Optimization Audit & Consolidation Task

You are a backend integration engineer working on a legacy audit pipeline. Your system receives optimization results from multiple generations of solver engines, consolidates the data for a Windows-based auditing tool, and generates a final signed report.

## Environment & Configuration

The working environment contains several configuration sources and data directories. It is critical that you use the **system-wide** configuration deployed by the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, located at `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`, rather than any local developer overrides you might find in the user home directory.

### Input Data

The solver outputs are located in `/home/user/api_test/responses`. This directory contains a mix of files:

1.  **Modern Solver Outputs (`.json`)**: Standard RFC-compliant JSON files encoded in UTF-8.
2.  **Legacy Solver Outputs (`.log`)**: These are "JSON-like" files generated by an old C++ subsystem.
    *   **Encoding**: These files are strictly encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**.
    *   **Comments**: They may contain C-style single-line comments (`// ...`) which are not valid JSON. You must strip these comments before parsing.
    *   **Note**: Attempting to read these as UTF-8 will cause errors due to special characters used in the comments.

## Task Requirements

You must write a solution that processes these files in a specific multi-stage pipeline.

### Stage 1: Ingestion & Normalization

Scan the responses directory. Ignore any files that do not end in `.json` or `.log`. For every file, parse the content (handling the encoding and comment stripping for legacy files described above). Discard any run where the `status` field is not "optimal" (case-insensitive).

### Stage 2: The Audit Manifest

Before determining the "winner", you must generate an intermediate audit manifest.

*   **File Path**: `/home/user/api_test/processed/manifest.csv`
*   **Content**: A CSV file listing the `id`, `objective_value`, and `timestamp` of **every** valid optimal run found in Stage 1.
*   **Ordering**: The rows must be sorted by `timestamp` in **descending** order (newest first).
*   **Format Constraints**: 
    *   Columns: `id,objective,timestamp`
    *   Since this file is consumed by a legacy Windows tool, it **must** use CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings. This is a strict requirement.
    *   No header row.

### Stage 3: Winner Selection

Select the single "best" run from the valid optimal runs identified in Stage 1.

1.  **Primary Criteria**: Lowest `objective_value`.
2.  **Tie-Breaker**: If objective values are equal, consult the `tie_breaker` key in the system configuration file (`/opt/solver/settings.yaml`).
    *   If set to `latest`, pick the run with the highest timestamp.
    *   If set to `earliest`, pick the run with the lowest timestamp.

### Stage 4: Final Report

Generate the final log file at `/home/user/api_test/optimization_report.log`. The format is specific and must be exact.

**Required Content & Format:**

```text
AUDIT_DATE: <current_utc_date_iso8601>
WINNER_ID: <id_of_winning_run>
MANIFEST_SHA256: <sha256_checksum_of_manifest.csv>
MANIFEST_LINE: <line_number_of_winner_in_manifest.csv>
VARIABLES: <formatted_variable_list>
```

**Field Details:**
*   `AUDIT_DATE`: The current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (UTC).
*   `MANIFEST_SHA256`: The hexadecimal SHA256 hash of the *exact* binary content of the `manifest.csv` file created in Stage 2. This ensures the audit trail is tamper-proof.
*   `MANIFEST_LINE`: The 1-based line number where the winning run appears in the sorted `manifest.csv`.
*   `VARIABLES`: A comma-separated list of the `x` array from the winning run, filtered and formatted as follows:
    *   **Threshold**: Only include variables where `abs(x)` is strictly greater than the `variable_threshold` defined in `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`.
    *   **Formatting**: 
        *   If `abs(x) < 0.01`, format in scientific notation with 2 decimal places (e.g., `5.00e-04`).
        *   Otherwise, format as a fixed-point number with 2 decimal places (e.g., `1.23`).

## Summary of Deliverables

By the end of execution, the following must exist:
1.  `/home/user/api_test/processed/manifest.csv` (CRLF line endings, sorted by time desc).
2.  `/home/user/api_test/optimization_report.log` (Containing the hash of the manifest).
