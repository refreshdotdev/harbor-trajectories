  "analysis": "I've navigated to the project directory and examined the configuration. The system-wide settings in `/opt/solver/settings.yaml` specify a `variable_threshold` of `0.001` and a `tie_breaker` strategy of `latest` (meaning if objective values are equal, the run with the highest timestamp wins). The `responses` directory contains several files, but most appear to be empty based on their file sizes (0 bytes), which might indicate they are placeholder files or actual data is missing. The file `run_e.bak` (12 bytes) might contain content. I need to inspect the content of these files to understand the actual data format and proceed with the processing pipeline.",
  "plan": "I will now inspect the content of the files in the `responses` directory to verify their structure and content. This will help me understand whether they contain valid JSON/log data and what fields are available. I'll start by examining `run_e.bak` since it has non-zero size, then proceed to check the other files if necessary.",
