  "analysis": "I am starting a new task. The user is root and located in the home directory. The primary task involves processing solver output files from `/home/user/api_test/responses`, using a system-wide configuration at `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`, and generating outputs in `/home/user/api_test/processed/` and `/home/user/api_test/`. The first step is to navigate to the relevant directory and examine the input files.",
  "plan": "1. Navigate to the `/home/user/api_test` directory. 2. Explore the structure of the `responses` and `processed` directories to understand what files are available. 3. Check if the system configuration file `/opt/solver/settings.yaml` exists and examine its contents to understand the tie-breaker rule and variable threshold. This information is crucial for later stages.",
