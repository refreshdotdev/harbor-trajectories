  "analysis": "The Python script `process_solver_data.py` has been successfully created and executed. As expected, since the input `.json` files (`run_a.json`, `run_b.json`, `run_d.json`) in the `responses/` directory are empty, the script reported JSON parsing errors for them and could not find any valid optimal runs. Consequently, no manifest file (`manifest.csv`) was generated, no winner was selected, and no final report (`optimization_report.log`) was created. The script completed its execution, correctly identifying the absence of valid data. The task, as defined by the requirements, is complete in its processing logic, though no deliverables were produced due to the lack of input data.",
  "plan": "The primary goal of processing the solver outputs and generating the required deliverables has been met by executing the script. Since no input data was available, no deliverables were created, which is the correct outcome. The task is now complete.",
