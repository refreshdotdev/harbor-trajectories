Log median network round-trip latency using `ping -c 5 8.8.8.8` and parse the output. 6. Log network jitter using the same ping command output. 7. Calculate benchmark duration from the timestamps of the first and last log entries. 8. Create the JSON summary file. 9. Display the contents of the audit log.",
