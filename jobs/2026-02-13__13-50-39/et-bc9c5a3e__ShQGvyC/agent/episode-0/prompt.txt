You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a compliance analyst who has been asked to create a **re-runable performance benchmark** of the current host and to archive the raw measurements in a tightly-defined audit trail.
All work **must be done only with utilities that are already available in a minimal Linux installation** (do not install extra packages).
The resulting artefacts must match the exact paths and formats specified.

### Artefact Location

All output files must be placed in the directory specified by the environment variable `AUDIT_LOCATION`.
*   If `AUDIT_LOCATION` is not set, default to `/home/user/audit`.
*   Ensure the directory exists.
*   **Log Rotation**: If the file `benchmark_audit.log` already exists in the target directory, you **must** rename it to `benchmark_audit.log.old` before starting the new benchmark. (If a `.old` file also exists, overwrite it).

### Measurements

Generate **five** measurements using built-in, non-interactive commands:
1.  **CPU core count**
2.  **Total installed memory** (in MiB)
3.  **Sequential disk write speed** in MiB/s (measured with a temporary file that is later removed)
4.  **Median network round-trip latency** to 8.8.8.8 in ms, calculated from **exactly five** ICMP echo requests.
5.  **Network Jitter** in ms, calculated as the difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** round-trip times of the **same five** ICMP echo requests used for the latency measurement.

### Audit Log

Immediately after every measurement, append a single-line record to the log file `benchmark_audit.log` in the target directory.

Each record **must** follow this pipe-delimited format (one physical line, no wrapping):
`TIMESTAMP|MEASUREMENT_NAME|RAW_VALUE|UNIT|COMMAND`

*   **TIMESTAMP**: ISO-8601 combined date and time in UTC, precise to whole seconds, e.g. `2024-05-14T18:03:21Z`
*   **MEASUREMENT_NAME**: one of `CPU_CORES`, `MEM_TOTAL_MIB`, `DISK_WRITE_MIBPS`, `NET_LATENCY_MS`, `NET_JITTER_MS`
*   **RAW_VALUE**: a positive decimal number (integer or float) extracted from the command output
*   **UNIT**: “count”, “MiB”, “MiB/s”, or “ms” respectively
*   **COMMAND**: exactly the full command line you executed to obtain the value

Example (do **not** copy literally):
`2024-05-14T18:03:21Z|CPU_CORES|4|count|nproc`

### Summary Report

After all five measurements have been logged, create a machine-readable summary file at `benchmark_summary.json` in the target directory with the following **exact key set and ordering**:

```json
{
  "cpu_core_count": <number>,
  "total_memory_bytes": <number>,
  "disk_write_mib_per_sec": <number>,
  "network_latency_ms": <number>,
  "network_jitter_ms": <number>,
  "benchmark_duration_seconds": <number>,
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 UTC string"
}
```

**Constraints:**
*   **total_memory_bytes**: Must be the memory value converted to **Bytes** (integer).
*   **benchmark_duration_seconds**: The elapsed time in seconds between the timestamp of the **first** log entry and the **last** log entry. Must be a float formatted to 3 decimal places (e.g., `5.000`).
*   The “timestamp” key in the JSON is the time the summary file is written.
*   All other numeric values must match the `RAW_VALUE` in the log.

### Final State

Ensure that any temporary files created for measuring disk speed are deleted, leaving only the expected artefacts inside the audit directory.

Finally, display the full contents of the `benchmark_audit.log` in the terminal.

### Task Success Criteria
*   The target directory contains `benchmark_audit.log` with **exactly five lines**.
*   If a log existed previously, `benchmark_audit.log.old` exists.
*   `benchmark_summary.json` exists, is valid JSON, and strictly follows the schema and value transformations defined above.
*   No other files (like disk speed temp files) remain in the directory.
*   The log's contents are displayed in the terminal.
