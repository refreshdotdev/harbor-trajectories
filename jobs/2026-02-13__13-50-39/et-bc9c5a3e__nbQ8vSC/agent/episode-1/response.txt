  "analysis": "The script execution hit several errors:\n1. `bc: command not found` - This utility is not available in a minimal Linux installation, which violates the task constraint.\n2. The ping command output parsing failed because `ping_output` was empty, leading to an empty `ping_times.tmp` file. This caused the latencies array to be empty, resulting in errors when trying to access array elements later.\n3. The subsequent calculations for median latency and jitter using `bc` also failed due to `bc` not being available and the lack of ping data.\n4. The jq command to create the summary JSON likely failed because variables like `mem_kib`, `disk_speed_mibs`, `median_lat`, and `jitter` were either empty or invalid.\n\nThe plan needs to be revised to use only utilities available in a minimal installation and handle potential failures more robustly.",
  "plan": "1. Replace `bc` with `awk` for floating point calculations.\n2. Ensure the ping command produces reliable output and handle cases where it might fail or produce no timings.\n3. Use `awk` for numerical comparisons and calculations instead of relying on `bc`.\n4. Verify that all variables are properly initialized before use in the JSON summary.\n5. Add error checking for critical operations like file creation and command execution.",
