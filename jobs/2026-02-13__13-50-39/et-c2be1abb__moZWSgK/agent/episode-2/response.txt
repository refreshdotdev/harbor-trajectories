  "analysis": "The redaction string '<<CONFIDENTIAL>>' has been successfully retrieved. The `file` command is not available in this environment. However, the `head` command has provided sample log lines from both `server_app.log` and `server_sys.log`. The timestamps appear to be in `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS` format as expected. The `server_app.log` seems to have UTF-16LE encoding issues (only 3 lines shown for 5 requested) which is consistent with the problem description. The log entries contain IPv4 addresses that need redaction.",
  "plan": "1. Convert `logs/server_app.log` from UTF-16LE to UTF-8 using `iconv`. 2. Convert `logs/server_sys.log` from Windows-1252 to UTF-8 using `iconv`. 3. Filter out `DEBUG` and `TRACE` severity levels from both logs. 4. Redact IPv4 addresses in the remaining log messages using the string '<<CONFIDENTIAL>>'. 5. Extract the timestamp, severity, and message components from each valid log line.",
