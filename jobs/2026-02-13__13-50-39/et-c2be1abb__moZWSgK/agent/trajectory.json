      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a forensic data analyst working on a post-incident review. A legacy Windows server was compromised, and the incident response team has dumped a raw archive of the relevant logs and configuration snippets.\n\nYour task is to process this archive, extract specific log entries, merge them, and generate a sanitized report for the legal department. The legal department uses an ancient document viewer, so strict adherence to encoding and formatting constraints is critical.\n\n### Current Situation\n\n*   **Directory**: `/home/user/incident_response`\n*   **Input File**: `/home/user/incident_response/evidence.zip`\n    *   This archive contains multiple files in a directory structure.\n    *   You must extract it to process the contents.\n\n### Processing Requirements\n\n1.  **Configuration Discovery**:\n    *   Inside the archive, locate a configuration file named `redaction.conf`.\n    *   This file contains a single line of text (e.g., `REDACTED_BY_SEC_TEAM`). You must use this *exact* string for all redactions.\n\n2.  **Log Merging and Filtering**:\n    *   The archive contains two log files: `server_app.log` and `server_sys.log`.\n    *   **Encoding Trap**: `server_app.log` is UTF-16LE (with BOM). `server_sys.log` is Windows-1252 (CP1252).\n    *   **Content**: Both files contain lines starting with a timestamp in the format `[DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]`, followed by a severity level and a message.\n    *   **Filtering**: You must exclude any log lines where the severity level is `DEBUG` or `TRACE`. Keep `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.\n    *   **Redaction**: Replace any IPv4 address (pattern `X.X.X.X`) found in the messages with the string found in `redaction.conf`.\n\n3.  **Sorting (The \"Chronological\" Requirement)**:\n    *   Merge the valid lines from both files into a single list.\n    *   Sort the merged list by **Timestamp Descending** (Newest first).\n    *   *Note*: A simple lexicographical sort will fail because the date format is Day-First (`DD/MM/YYYY`). You must parse the dates to sort correctly.\n\n4.  **Header Generation**:\n    *   The archive contains a binary file `signature.bin`.\n    *   The first line of your output report must be the **MD5 hash** of this binary file.\n\n5.  **Report Formatting (Strict)**:\n    *   **Output Path**: `/home/user/incident_response/final_report.txt`\n    *   **Encoding**: The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Ensure all characters in the logs are compatible or replaced with `?`.\n    *   **Line Endings**: The file must use Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings for *every* line, including the header.\n    *   **Structure**:\n        Line 1: `<MD5_HASH_OF_SIGNATURE_BIN>`\n        Line 2+: `<Timestamp> <Severity> <Redacted_Message>`\n\n6.  **Manifest Generation**:\n    *   Create a JSON manifest at `/home/user/incident_response/manifest.json`.\n    *   It must contain exactly these keys:\n        *   `processed_date`: The current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).\n        *   `total_lines_reported`: Integer count of log lines in the final report (excluding the header).\n        *   `redaction_string`: The string used for redaction.\n        *   `report_sha256`: The SHA256 hash of the generated `final_report.txt`.\n    *   The JSON must be formatted with an indentation of 2 spaces.\n\n### Verification\n\nThe grading script checks specific byte sequences. If your line endings are LF instead of CRLF, or if the sort order is wrong (e.g., `01/02/2023` appearing before `02/01/2023` in a descending sort), or if the encoding is UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, the task will fail.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c9fc9e2e-d5a8-4618-9f7d-4b3e4b982314:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
