This indicates that either the `$BUILD_ID` environment variable is not set, or the configuration file `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini` was not read correctly by the initial `grep` and `sed` command. The subsequent commands rely on `$ROOT_DIR` being set. The immediate task is to debug why `$ROOT_DIR` is empty.",
  "plan": "1. Check if the environment variable `$BUILD_ID` is set. 2. Read the `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini` file explicitly to inspect its contents and determine why the `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH` were not extracted. 3. Manually define `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH` based on observed INI content for now to proceed with the task. 4. Continue with Part A of the scan: identifying world-writable files.",
