This involves reading configuration from `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`, scanning a specified `ROOT_DIR` for world-writable files and TODO comments, formatting the results according to strict rules, encoding the report in ISO-8859-1 with character replacement, calculating an MD5 checksum, and printing a JSON status message. No steps have been taken yet.",
