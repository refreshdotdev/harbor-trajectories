  "analysis": "The `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT` assignment failed because the string `MD5: $MD5_CHECKSUM` was appended directly to the variable name `\"$REPORT_CONTENT\"MD5: ...` without proper syntax for string concatenation in variable assignment, causing the shell to interpret it as a command. The `CONTENT_BEFORE_MD5` and `MD5_CHECKSUM` variables were correctly populated. The `BUILD_ID` was set to `UNSET_BUILD_ID` as it was not in the environment. The next step is to correctly construct the `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT` by concatenating strings.",
  "plan": "1. Reconstruct `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT` using proper string concatenation. This can be done by `REPORT_CONTENT=\"${REPORT_CONTENT}MD5: ${MD5_CHECKSUM}\"` or by initializing `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT` with the combined string. 2. Write `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT` to the `REPORT_PATH` (`/home/user/audit/scan_report.dat`). 3. Handle ISO-8859-1 encoding and character replacement. This can be done using `iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT`. 4. Print the JSON status message.",
