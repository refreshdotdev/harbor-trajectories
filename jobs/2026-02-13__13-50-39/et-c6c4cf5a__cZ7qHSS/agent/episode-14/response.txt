  "analysis": "The command `echo -n \"$FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT\" | iconv ...` failed because of a missing newline character in the previous command's input. Specifically, the command `FINAL_REPORT_CONTENT=\"${REPORT_CONTENT}MD5: ${MD5_CHECKSUM}\"` was submitted without a trailing newline, causing the subsequent `echo -n ...` command to be interpreted as part of the same line. This led to the error `bash: -n: command not found` because `echo-n` is not a valid command. The JSON status message was printed, but its `report_file` field contained the literal string `\"${REPORT_PATH}\"` instead of the variable's value, and the report itself was not written. The task cannot be considered complete.",
  "plan": "Correct the report writing command by ensuring it's a standalone command and fixing the `echo` options. The `-n` option for `echo` is generally not needed if the content to be written already includes necessary newlines, or can be used carefully. For robustness, we can use `printf` or ensure `echo` behaves predictably. The JSON output also needs to correctly expand the `REPORT_PATH` variable. Since the report was not successfully written and the JSON was malformed, the task is not complete. The next step is to re-attempt writing the report and printing the correct JSON.",
