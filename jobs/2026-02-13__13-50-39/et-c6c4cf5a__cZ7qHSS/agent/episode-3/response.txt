  "analysis": "The configuration values `ROOT_DIR='/home/user/release'` and `REPORT_PATH='/home/user/audit/scan_report.dat'` have been confirmed. The parent directory `/home/user/audit` for the report has been created. The next step is to generate the content for Part A of the report: world-writable files. This involves finding files in `ROOT_DIR` that are world-writable, excluding symbolic links and files in hidden directories, then sorting them by size (descending) and path (alphabetically), and formatting them.",
  "plan": "Construct and execute a command to find world-writable files as per the requirements for Part A. This will use `find` with options to exclude symbolic links (`! -type l`) and files in hidden directories (using a `path` pattern with `! -path`). The `find` command will output file paths and sizes. This output will then be sorted: primarily by size in descending order, and secondarily by absolute path in alphabetical order. The output format will be `SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH`. The result will be stored in a temporary file for later assembly into the main report.",
