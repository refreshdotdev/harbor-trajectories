The task requires reading configuration from `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`, performing scans based on that configuration, and generating a report in ISO-8859-1 encoding. The first step is to read this configuration file to understand the `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH`.",
  "plan": "1. Read the `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini` configuration file to extract `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH`. 2. Verify that `ROOT_DIR` exists and is a directory. 3. Verify that the parent directory of `REPORT_PATH` exists and is a directory, creating it if necessary. 4. Initialize the report content with the `SCAN_ID` header, using the value of the `$BUILD_ID` environment variable. 5. Perform Part A (World-Writable Files) scan within `ROOT_DIR`. 6. Perform Part B (TODO Comments) scan within `ROOT_DIR`. 7. Assemble the complete report content, including section separators. 8. Convert the report content to ISO-8859-1 encoding, replacing non-representable characters with '?'. 9. Write the encoded content to `REPORT_PATH`. 10. Calculate the MD5 checksum of the written content and append it as the last line of the report. 11. Print the final JSON status message to stdout.",
