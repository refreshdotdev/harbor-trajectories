  "plan": "1. Use `find` to locate all world-writable files within `ROOT_DIR`. Constraints: exclude symbolic links (`-type f`), exclude files inside hidden directories (paths containing `/.`), and files must have others write permission (`-perm -0002`). 2. For each file found, format the output as `SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH` (two spaces between size and path). 3. Sort the results: primarily by file size in descending order, and secondarily by absolute path alphabetically for files of the same size. 4. Append these formatted lines to `REPORT_CONTENT`.",
