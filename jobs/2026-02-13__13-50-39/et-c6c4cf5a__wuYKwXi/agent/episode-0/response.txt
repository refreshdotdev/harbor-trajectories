The first step is to examine the configuration file `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini` to determine the `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH`.",
  "plan": "1. Attempt to read the main configuration file `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`. 2. If a general error occurs with /etc/oldguard/scanner.ini (e.g., permission issue), try to access it using `sudo`. 3. If OldGuard is not installed system-wide, check for a local scanner.ini in a user-writable location like `/tmp`. 4. If no scanner.ini is found, check if the task expects a default `ROOT_DIR` of `/home/user/release` as hinted in the problem description.",
