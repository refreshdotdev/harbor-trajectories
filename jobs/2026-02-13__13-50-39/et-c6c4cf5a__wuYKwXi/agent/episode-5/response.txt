The `sed 's|:\\|\\|g'` was intended to escape colons for `sort` but is malformed. I will remove the problematic `sed` command and retry. The temporary file `/tmp/todo_temp.txt` is empty.",
  "plan": "1. Retry the TODO comments scan without the faulty `sed` command. Path names containing colons will be handled by `sort` using `--field-separator=:` if they appear, or by ensuring the path is treated as a single field. 2. If no TODOs are found, the section will be empty as required.",
