  "analysis": "The command to find world-writable files mostly succeeded, but there were some 'No such file or directory' errors. This suggests that the `xargs -I {} find $(dirname '{}') -samefile '{}'` part might not be correctly resolving the paths, possibly due to spaces or special characters in the output from `ls -l`. I need to refine this approach to ensure reliable path resolution and sorting.",
  "plan": "I will simplify the command. First, I'll use `find` with appropriate options to locate world-writable files (excluding symlinks and hidden directories). Then, I'll use `xargs -0` with `ls -l` to handle filenames with spaces correctly. I'll store the full `ls -l` output temporarily, extract the size and path, sort them, and then format the output as required.",
