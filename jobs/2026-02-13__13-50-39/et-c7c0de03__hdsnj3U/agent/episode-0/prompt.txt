You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Data Archival & Sanitation Task

**From:** Chief Data Architect
**To:** Junior DevOps Engineer
**Subject:** URGENT: Fix Dave's mess in the landing zone

We have a situation. Our previous engineer, Dave, left the `incoming` data folder in a chaotic state before he quit. The downstream ETL pipeline is choking on invalid files, encoding mismatches, and garbage data. We need you to create a sanitized "Golden Backup" of the current state before we wipe the directory.

Your task is to produce a compliant archive in `/home/user/etl_workspace/backups/incoming_backup.tar.gz` and a corresponding manifest file.

### The Context (Read Carefully)

The current directory `/home/user/etl_workspace/incoming/` is a minefield. Dave set his IDE to `ISO-8859-1` (Latin-1), so `march.csv` is encoded incorrectly. The warehouse strictly requires **UTF-8**, so you must transcode this file in the backup. Do not touch the original file on disk; only the archived version should be fixed. Furthermore, the `config.json` file he generated contains trailing commas (e.g., `{"key": "value",}`), which is invalid JSON. You must sanitize this file by removing those commas so it parses correctly as standard JSON in the archive.

We also found that Dave was dumping intermediate processing data into folders named `staging` and creating temporary files with `temp` in the name (e.g., `temp_001.dat`). Per our GDPR retention policy, **exclude** any directory named `staging` (and its contents) and any file whose name contains the substring `temp` (case-insensitive) from the archive. However, do include hidden files (starting with `.`) if they are directly in the `incoming` root, but exclude them if they are inside any subdirectory.

### The Manifest Requirement

To ensure auditability, you must generate a sidecar file named `/home/user/etl_workspace/backups/manifest.json`. This file must contain a JSON object where the keys are the paths of the files *as they appear in the archive* (e.g., `incoming/january.csv`) and the values are the **SHA256 hashes** of the file contents. **Crucial:** The hashes must reflect the *sanitized* content (UTF-8 converted, JSON fixed), not the original raw bytes. For symlinks, hash the content of the target file. The manifest itself should be pretty-printed with an indentation of 4 spaces and sorted alphabetically by key.

### Metadata & Timestamps

Here is the tricky part that trips everyone up: Even though you are modifying the content of `march.csv` and `config.json`, the **modification timestamp (mtime)** of these files in the archive must match the original source file's mtime. We use mtime to track data freshness, so resetting it to "now" would break our SLA tracking.

Finally, the `incoming_backup.tar.gz` archive file itself must have its modification time set to match the timestamp of the *newest* file contained within it. This allows our tape backup system to recognize the effective date of the data.

### Summary of Deliverables

1.  **Archive**: `/home/user/etl_workspace/backups/incoming_backup.tar.gz`
    *   Root folder: `incoming/`
    *   Format: Gzip compressed tar
    *   Content: Sanitized and filtered copy of source.
2.  **Manifest**: `/home/user/etl_workspace/backups/manifest.json`
    *   Format: JSON, indent 4.
    *   Content: `{ "path/in/tar": "sha256_of_processed_file" }`

**Do not modify the source directory.** Work in a temporary location if needed. Ensure the `backups` directory exists.
