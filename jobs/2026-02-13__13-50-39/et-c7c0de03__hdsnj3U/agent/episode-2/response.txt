  "analysis": "I've examined the `incoming` directory and identified several key files and directories: `config.json`, `march.csv`, `january.csv`, `february.csv`, a symlink `latest.csv`, a hidden file `.meta`, a `staging` directory, and a file named `temp_cache.log`. Based on the requirements, I must sanitize `march.csv` (convert to UTF-8) and `config.json` (fix trailing commas). I must also exclude the entire `staging` directory and any files containing 'temp' in their name (case-insensitive). The `.meta` file is a hidden file in the root of `incoming`, so it should be included.",
  "plan": "1. Copy the `.meta` hidden file from `incoming` to the staging area `tmp_archive_staging/incoming` without any modifications. 2. Copy `january.csv` and `february.csv` to the staging area; these files do not require sanitization and their names do not match the exclusion criteria. 3. Begin preparing the sanitization commands for `march.csv` and `config.json`.",
