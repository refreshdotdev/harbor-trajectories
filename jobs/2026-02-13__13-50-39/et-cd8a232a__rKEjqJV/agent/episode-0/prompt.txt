You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are helping a script-developer who maintains a collection of tiny shell utilities under `/home/user/scripts`.
A new requirement has arrived: the developer wants a **regex-based log filtering utility** that extracts “critical” lines from an application log and produces both
 a) a filtered log with redactions and metadata,
 b) a tiny CSV summary of error categories seen.

Your goal is to create everything needed so that, after you are done, the following will be true:

1. The directory `/home/user/scripts` contains an **executable Bash script** called `filter_errors.sh`.
2. Running the command

   `/home/user/scripts/filter_errors.sh /home/user/logs/app_2023-08-15.log /home/user/output`

   produces exactly two files inside `/home/user/output`:
   • `critical_errors.log` (the filtered lines with header and redactions)
   • `error_summary.csv` (the sorted category counts)

3. **Filtering & Multi-line Handling**:
   The filtered log must contain lines that match at least one of these regexes (case-sensitive):
   • `ERROR`
   • `FATAL`
   • `HTTP\/1\.1 5[0-9]{2}`

   **Crucially**, the log contains multi-line entries (e.g., stack traces). A log entry begins with a timestamp in brackets (e.g., `[2023-08-15...]`).
   • If a line starting with a timestamp matches a critical regex, you must preserve that line **AND** any subsequent lines that do **not** start with a timestamp (indented stack traces, etc.).
   • If a line starting with a timestamp does not match, ignore it and its subsequent continuation lines.

4. **Header & Redaction**:
   • The `critical_errors.log` file must start with a single header line: `# Source: <absolute_path_to_input_log>`.
   • Following the header, append the filtered log entries maintaining their original order.
   • **Redaction**: For privacy, any substring matching an email address (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`) within the filtered content must be replaced with the string `<REDACTED>`.

5. **CSV Summary & Sorting**:
   The script must classify each **log entry** (based on the content of the timestamped line) into exactly one of the following categories (first matching rule wins):
   • contains substring “Payment failed” → category `PAYMENT_FAILURE`
   • matches regex `HTTP\/1\.1 5[0-9]{2}` → category `HTTP_5XX`
   • contains substring “FATAL” → category `FATAL`

   The CSV must have the header `error_category,count`.
   **Sorting Rule**: The data rows must be sorted first by **count (descending)**, and then by **category name (alphabetically ascending)**.

   Expected CSV layout example:
   ```
   error_category,count
   PAYMENT_FAILURE,2
   FATAL,1
   HTTP_5XX,1
   ```

6. The script must:
   • Accept exactly two positional arguments: `<input_log>` and `<output_dir>`.
   • Create `<output_dir>` if it does not already exist.
   • Overwrite output files if they already exist.
   • Use only standard POSIX/Linux utilities (bash, awk, sed, grep, sort, etc.).

7. When finished, append a short execution log to `/home/user/filter_run.log` containing one line with this exact pipe-separated format:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM:SS|input=<absolute_input_path>|output_dir=<absolute_output_dir>|status=OK
   ```
   • Use the current local time.

When the grader checks your work it will:
a) run the script as shown above,
b) verify strict file existence, content, redaction, sorting, and formatting.
