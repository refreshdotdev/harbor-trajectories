            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are helping a script-developer who maintains a collection of tiny shell utilities under `/home/user/scripts`.\nA new requirement has arrived: the developer wants a **regex-based log filtering utility** that extracts \u201ccritical\u201d lines from an application log and produces both\n a) a filtered log with redactions and metadata,\n b) a tiny CSV summary of error categories seen.\n\nYour goal is to create everything needed so that, after you are done, the following will be true:\n\n1. The directory `/home/user/scripts` contains an **executable Bash script** called `filter_errors.sh`.\n2. Running the command\n\n   `/home/user/scripts/filter_errors.sh /home/user/logs/app_2023-08-15.log /home/user/output`\n\n   produces exactly two files inside `/home/user/output`:\n   \u2022 `critical_errors.log` (the filtered lines with header and redactions)\n   \u2022 `error_summary.csv` (the sorted category counts)\n\n3. **Filtering & Multi-line Handling**:\n   The filtered log must contain lines that match at least one of these regexes (case-sensitive):\n   \u2022 `ERROR`\n   \u2022 `FATAL`\n   \u2022 `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}`\n\n   **Crucially**, the log contains multi-line entries (e.g., stack traces). A log entry begins with a timestamp in brackets (e.g., `[2023-08-15...]`).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp matches a critical regex, you must preserve that line **AND** any subsequent lines that do **not** start with a timestamp (indented stack traces, etc.).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp does not match, ignore it and its subsequent continuation lines.\n\n4. **Header & Redaction**:\n   \u2022 The `critical_errors.log` file must start with a single header line: `# Source: <absolute_path_to_input_log>`.\n   \u2022 Following the header, append the filtered log entries maintaining their original order.\n   \u2022 **Redaction**: For privacy, any substring matching an email address (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`) within the filtered content must be replaced with the string `<REDACTED>`.\n\n5. **CSV Summary & Sorting**:\n   The script must classify each **log entry** (based on the content of the timestamped line) into exactly one of the following categories (first matching rule wins):\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cPayment failed\u201d \u2192 category `PAYMENT_FAILURE`\n   \u2022 matches regex `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}` \u2192 category `HTTP_5XX`\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cFATAL\u201d \u2192 category `FATAL`\n\n   The CSV must have the header `error_category,count`.\n   **Sorting Rule**: The data rows must be sorted first by **count (descending)**, and then by **category name (alphabetically ascending)**.\n\n   Expected CSV layout example:\n   ```\n   error_category,count\n   PAYMENT_FAILURE,2\n   FATAL,1\n   HTTP_5XX,1\n   ```\n\n6. The script must:\n   \u2022 Accept exactly two positional arguments: `<input_log>` and `<output_dir>`.\n   \u2022 Create `<output_dir>` if it does not already exist.\n   \u2022 Overwrite output files if they already exist.\n   \u2022 Use only standard POSIX/Linux utilities (bash, awk, sed, grep, sort, etc.).\n\n7. When finished, append a short execution log to `/home/user/filter_run.log` containing one line with this exact pipe-separated format:\n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM:SS|input=<absolute_input_path>|output_dir=<absolute_output_dir>|status=OK\n   ```\n   \u2022 Use the current local time.\n\nWhen the grader checks your work it will:\na) run the script as shown above,\nb) verify strict file existence, content, redaction, sorting, and formatting.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@9be0b58d-c285-4cb3-b2c2-99c8d98bd056:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are helping a script-developer who maintains a collection of tiny shell utilities under `/home/user/scripts`.\nA new requirement has arrived: the developer wants a **regex-based log filtering utility** that extracts \u201ccritical\u201d lines from an application log and produces both\n a) a filtered log with redactions and metadata,\n b) a tiny CSV summary of error categories seen.\n\nYour goal is to create everything needed so that, after you are done, the following will be true:\n\n1. The directory `/home/user/scripts` contains an **executable Bash script** called `filter_errors.sh`.\n2. Running the command\n\n   `/home/user/scripts/filter_errors.sh /home/user/logs/app_2023-08-15.log /home/user/output`\n\n   produces exactly two files inside `/home/user/output`:\n   \u2022 `critical_errors.log` (the filtered lines with header and redactions)\n   \u2022 `error_summary.csv` (the sorted category counts)\n\n3. **Filtering & Multi-line Handling**:\n   The filtered log must contain lines that match at least one of these regexes (case-sensitive):\n   \u2022 `ERROR`\n   \u2022 `FATAL`\n   \u2022 `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}`\n\n   **Crucially**, the log contains multi-line entries (e.g., stack traces). A log entry begins with a timestamp in brackets (e.g., `[2023-08-15...]`).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp matches a critical regex, you must preserve that line **AND** any subsequent lines that do **not** start with a timestamp (indented stack traces, etc.).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp does not match, ignore it and its subsequent continuation lines.\n\n4. **Header & Redaction**:\n   \u2022 The `critical_errors.log` file must start with a single header line: `# Source: <absolute_path_to_input_log>`.\n   \u2022 Following the header, append the filtered log entries maintaining their original order.\n   \u2022 **Redaction**: For privacy, any substring matching an email address (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`) within the filtered content must be replaced with the string `<REDACTED>`.\n\n5. **CSV Summary & Sorting**:\n   The script must classify each **log entry** (based on the content of the timestamped line) into exactly one of the following categories (first matching rule wins):\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cPayment failed\u201d \u2192 category `PAYMENT_FAILURE`\n   \u2022 matches regex `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}` \u2192 category `HTTP_5XX`\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cFATAL\u201d \u2192 category `FATAL`\n\n   The CSV must have the header `error_category,count`.\n   **Sorting Rule**: The data rows must be sorted first by **count (descending)**, and then by **category name (alphabetically ascending)**.\n\n   Expected CSV layout example:\n   ```\n   error_category,count\n   PAYMENT_FAILURE,2\n   FATAL,1\n   HTTP_5XX,1\n   ```\n\n6. The script must:\n   \u2022 Accept exactly two positional arguments: `<input_log>` and `<output_dir>`.\n   \u2022 Create `<output_dir>` if it does not already exist.\n   \u2022 Overwrite output files if they already exist.\n   \u2022 Use only standard POSIX/Linux utilities (bash, awk, sed, grep, sort, etc.).\n\n7. When finished, append a short execution log to `/home/user/filter_run.log` containing one line with this exact pipe-separated format:\n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM:SS|input=<absolute_input_path>|output_dir=<absolute_output_dir>|status=OK\n   ```\n   \u2022 Use the current local time.\n\nWhen the grader checks your work it will:\na) run the script as shown above,\nb) verify strict file existence, content, redaction, sorting, and formatting.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@9be0b58d-c285-4cb3-b2c2-99c8d98bd056:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are helping a script-developer who maintains a collection of tiny shell utilities under `/home/user/scripts`.\nA new requirement has arrived: the developer wants a **regex-based log filtering utility** that extracts \u201ccritical\u201d lines from an application log and produces both\n a) a filtered log with redactions and metadata,\n b) a tiny CSV summary of error categories seen.\n\nYour goal is to create everything needed so that, after you are done, the following will be true:\n\n1. The directory `/home/user/scripts` contains an **executable Bash script** called `filter_errors.sh`.\n2. Running the command\n\n   `/home/user/scripts/filter_errors.sh /home/user/logs/app_2023-08-15.log /home/user/output`\n\n   produces exactly two files inside `/home/user/output`:\n   \u2022 `critical_errors.log` (the filtered lines with header and redactions)\n   \u2022 `error_summary.csv` (the sorted category counts)\n\n3. **Filtering & Multi-line Handling**:\n   The filtered log must contain lines that match at least one of these regexes (case-sensitive):\n   \u2022 `ERROR`\n   \u2022 `FATAL`\n   \u2022 `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}`\n\n   **Crucially**, the log contains multi-line entries (e.g., stack traces). A log entry begins with a timestamp in brackets (e.g., `[2023-08-15...]`).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp matches a critical regex, you must preserve that line **AND** any subsequent lines that do **not** start with a timestamp (indented stack traces, etc.).\n   \u2022 If a line starting with a timestamp does not match, ignore it and its subsequent continuation lines.\n\n4. **Header & Redaction**:\n   \u2022 The `critical_errors.log` file must start with a single header line: `# Source: <absolute_path_to_input_log>`.\n   \u2022 Following the header, append the filtered log entries maintaining their original order.\n   \u2022 **Redaction**: For privacy, any substring matching an email address (regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`) within the filtered content must be replaced with the string `<REDACTED>`.\n\n5. **CSV Summary & Sorting**:\n   The script must classify each **log entry** (based on the content of the timestamped line) into exactly one of the following categories (first matching rule wins):\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cPayment failed\u201d \u2192 category `PAYMENT_FAILURE`\n   \u2022 matches regex `HTTP\\/1\\.1 5[0-9]{2}` \u2192 category `HTTP_5XX`\n   \u2022 contains substring \u201cFATAL\u201d \u2192 category `FATAL`\n\n   The CSV must have the header `error_category,count`.\n   **Sorting Rule**: The data rows must be sorted first by **count (descending)**, and then by **category name (alphabetically ascending)**.\n\n   Expected CSV layout example:\n   ```\n   error_category,count\n   PAYMENT_FAILURE,2\n   FATAL,1\n   HTTP_5XX,1\n   ```\n\n6. The script must:\n   \u2022 Accept exactly two positional arguments: `<input_log>` and `<output_dir>`.\n   \u2022 Create `<output_dir>` if it does not already exist.\n   \u2022 Overwrite output files if they already exist.\n   \u2022 Use only standard POSIX/Linux utilities (bash, awk, sed, grep, sort, etc.).\n\n7. When finished, append a short execution log to `/home/user/filter_run.log` containing one line with this exact pipe-separated format:\n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD|HH:MM:SS|input=<absolute_input_path>|output_dir=<absolute_output_dir>|status=OK\n   ```\n   \u2022 Use the current local time.\n\nWhen the grader checks your work it will:\na) run the script as shown above,\nb) verify strict file existence, content, redaction, sorting, and formatting.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@9be0b58d-c285-4cb3-b2c2-99c8d98bd056:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
