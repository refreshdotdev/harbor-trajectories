You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Release Engineering Protocol v4.2

**Context**
You are the lead Release Engineer for the "LegacyIntegration" project. This pipeline bridges a modern XML-based build system with a legacy mainframe tracking system. You must process a build artifact, register it in the database, and generate specific synchronization files for downstream consumption.

**Environment Overview**
*   **Work Directory**: `/home/user/workspace`
*   **Database**: `/var/lib/db/production.db` (SQLite)
*   **Input Metadata**: `/home/user/workspace/incoming/build_meta.xml`
*   **Credentials**: Located in `/etc/opt/keys/`

## 1. Input Processing
The build system deposits a metadata file at `/home/user/workspace/incoming/build_meta.xml`. This file is generated by a Windows-based upstream service and is encoded in **UTF-16 Little Endian (UTF-16LE)**. You must parse this file to extract the version string (e.g., `v2.5.0`).

Additionally, you must determine the **Build Timestamp**. Due to a quirk in the upstream generator, the official build time is not inside the XML, but is defined as the filesystem modification time (mtime) of the `build_meta.xml` file itself, represented as a Unix integer timestamp.

## 2. Security & Signature
To ensure integrity, you must generate a cryptographic signature for this release.
*   Locate the signing key. There are multiple keys in `/etc/opt/keys/`, but you must use the one named `release_signing.key`. **Ignore** any files ending in `.bak` or `.example`.
*   The key file may contain surrounding whitespace which must be removed.
*   Construct the **Signature Payload** by concatenating the extracted **Version String** and the **Build Timestamp** (as a string). Example: if version is `v1.0` and timestamp is `1700000000`, the payload is `v1.0170000000`.
*   Compute the **HMAC-SHA256** of this payload using the signing key. The result should be a lowercase hex string.

## 3. Database Registration
The SQLite database at `/var/lib/db/production.db` contains a table named `deployment_log`. You must insert a new record.
*   **Schema**: `id` (Auto-inc), `iso_version` (Text), `deploy_time` (Integer), `integrity_hash` (Text), `status` (Text).
*   **Mapping**:
    *   `iso_version`: The version extracted from XML.
    *   `deploy_time`: The filesystem modification timestamp of the XML file.
    *   `integrity_hash`: The computed HMAC-SHA256 signature.
    *   `status`: Must be set to the string `'pending_audit'`.

## 4. Mainframe Synchronization (The "Legacy Log")
The legacy mainframe requires a CSV-like file to acknowledge the release. Create this file at `/home/user/workspace/outgoing/legacy_sync.dat`.

**Crucial Compatibility Requirements:**
Because the mainframe is an ancient system, this file has strict binary requirements:
1.  **Encoding**: It must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). UTF-8 will cause a mainframe crash.
2.  **Line Endings**: It must use Windows-style **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line endings.
3.  **Format**: A single line containing: `VERSION|TIMESTAMP|SIGNATURE` (pipe-delimited).

## 5. Modern Manifest (The "Seal")
Finally, create a JSON manifest for the modern web dashboard at `/home/user/workspace/outgoing/manifest.json`.

This file acts as a cryptographic seal for the legacy file. It must contain a JSON object with the following fields:
*   `"version"`: The version string.
*   `"legacy_file_sha256"`: The SHA-256 hash of the **exact binary content** of the `legacy_sync.dat` file you created in step 4.
*   `"signature"`: The HMAC signature.

**Constraints**
*   Your solution must not modify the input XML file.
*   The JSON manifest must be read-only (`0444`).
*   Do not create any temporary files that are not cleaned up.
*   Use the tools installed in the environment (Python 3, SQLite3, Bash).

Return to the prompt only when the database is updated and both output files exist with the correct content and permissions.
