  "analysis": "I am starting in the workspace directory `/home/user/workspace`. I need to process the UTF-16LE encoded build metadata file, extract version and build timestamp, generate a cryptographic signature, register the build in an SQLite database, create a mainframe-compatible legacy sync file, and generate a modern JSON manifest. No prior work has been done.",
  "plan": "First, I'll navigate to the workspace and examine the input metadata file. I'll need to parse the UTF-16LE XML to extract the version string. Then, I'll get the file's modification time as the build timestamp. Next, I'll locate the signing key, clean it, and use it to compute an HMAC-SHA256 signature. After that, I'll register the build in the SQLite database. I will then create the legacy sync file with specific ISO-8859-1 encoding and Windows CRLF line endings. Finally, I'll generate the JSON manifest containing the version, SHA-256 hash of the legacy file, and the HMAC signature.",
