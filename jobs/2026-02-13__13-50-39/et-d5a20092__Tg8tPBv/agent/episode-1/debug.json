Unlike previous months, we are in the middle of a migration from our legacy mainframe systems to a modern cloud infrastructure. This means the input data is heterogeneous, and strict data hygiene protocols are now in effect.\n\n## 1. Scope Definition\n\nDo not simply scan the entire raw directory. We have deprecated several regions. You must read `/home/user/capacity/config/manifest.txt` to determine which subdirectories within `/home/user/capacity/raw/` are active. The manifest lists relative directory names (one per line). Ignore empty lines or lines starting with `#`.\n\n## 2. Data Ingestion & format\n\nInside the active directories, identify files ending in `_202301.log`. You will encounter two types of systems:\n\n*   **Legacy Systems**: Identified by the string `legacy` in the filename (e.g., `server_legacy_202301.log`).\n    *   **Encoding**: These files are strictly **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1).\n    *   **Format**: Metrics are always integers.\n*   **Modern Systems**: All other files.\n    *   **Encoding**: These are **UTF-8**, but may contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM) which must be handled gracefully.\n    *   **Format**: Metrics are floating-point numbers.\n\nFiles must also be filtered by status. Only process files containing the exact line `meta_status: active`. The metric lines (CPU_USED, MEM_USED, DISK_USED) may appear in any order.\n\n## 3. Normalization & Aggregation\n\nBefore averaging, you must normalize the data stream:\n1.  **Rounding**: Convert all modern floating-point metrics to integers by rounding to the **nearest integer** (0.5 rounds up, e.g., 20.5 -> 21). Legacy integers require no rounding.\n2.  **Noise Filtering**: Our sensors are noisy. Discard any normalized integer value that is strictly **less than 5** or strictly **greater than 95**.\n3.  **Averaging**: Compute the arithmetic mean of the remaining valid values for each metric (CPU, MEM, DISK) across all valid files. Round the final average **down** to the nearest integer.\n\n## 4. Output Pipeline\n\nYou must generate three distinct artifacts in `/home/user/capacity/reports/`. Note that the manager views these files on a Windows workstation, so **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)** line endings are mandatory for text files.\n\n**Artifact A: Intermediate Data**\n*   File: `intermediate.json`\n*   Content: A flat JSON object mapping the metric names (keys: `AVG_CPU_USED`, `AVG_MEM_USED`, `AVG_DISK_USED`) to their calculated integer averages. Use compact formatting (no whitespace/newlines).\n\n**Artifact B: The Summary Report**\n*   File: `summary_202301.log`\n*   Line Endings: **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`).\n*   Content:\n    1.  `AVG_CPU_USED=<val>`\n    2.  `AVG_MEM_USED=<val>`\n    3.  `AVG_DISK_USED=<val>`\n    4.  `source_size=<bytes>` (where `<bytes>` is the exact file size of `intermediate.json` in bytes).\n\n**Artifact C: Binary Checksum**\n*   File: `checksum.bin`\n*   Content: The **raw binary** MD5 digest (16 bytes) of the `summary_202301.log` file. Do not store the hex string; store the actual bytes.\n\n## 5. Finalization\n\n1.  Update the symlink `/home/user/capacity/latest` to point to `summary_202301.log` (absolute path).\n2.  Append a strictly formatted line to `/home/user/capacity/operations.log`:\n    `Publication 2023-01: <N> files, Checksum: <SHA256>`\n    *   `<N>`: Total count of valid files processed.\n    *   `<SHA256>`: The lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the **`checksum.bin`** file you just created.\n    *   (Note: `operations.log` is a standard Linux log, so use standard LF line endings here).\n\n**Constraints**:\n*   No root privileges.\n*   Standard Python 3 libraries are available.\n*   Do not leave stray temporary files.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@5796a375-dbf6-41c9-a2c9-9c12d187c8ad:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Capacity Planning Automation - January 2023\n\nYou are tasked with generating the January 2023 capacity report. Unlike previous months, we are in the middle of a migration from our legacy mainframe systems to a modern cloud infrastructure. This means the input data is heterogeneous, and strict data hygiene protocols are now in effect.\n\n## 1. Scope Definition\n\nDo not simply scan the entire raw directory. We have deprecated several regions. You must read `/home/user/capacity/config/manifest.txt` to determine which subdirectories within `/home/user/capacity/raw/` are active. The manifest lists relative directory names (one per line). Ignore empty lines or lines starting with `#`.\n\n## 2. Data Ingestion & format\n\nInside the active directories, identify files ending in `_202301.log`. You will encounter two types of systems:\n\n*   **Legacy Systems**: Identified by the string `legacy` in the filename (e.g., `server_legacy_202301.log`).\n    *   **Encoding**: These files are strictly **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1).\n    *   **Format**: Metrics are always integers.\n*   **Modern Systems**: All other files.\n    *   **Encoding**: These are **UTF-8**, but may contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM) which must be handled gracefully.\n    *   **Format**: Metrics are floating-point numbers.\n\nFiles must also be filtered by status. Only process files containing the exact line `meta_status: active`. The metric lines (CPU_USED, MEM_USED, DISK_USED) may appear in any order.\n\n## 3. Normalization & Aggregation\n\nBefore averaging, you must normalize the data stream:\n1.  **Rounding**: Convert all modern floating-point metrics to integers by rounding to the **nearest integer** (0.5 rounds up, e.g., 20.5 -> 21). Legacy integers require no rounding.\n2.  **Noise Filtering**: Our sensors are noisy. Discard any normalized integer value that is strictly **less than 5** or strictly **greater than 95**.\n3.  **Averaging**: Compute the arithmetic mean of the remaining valid values for each metric (CPU, MEM, DISK) across all valid files. Round the final average **down** to the nearest integer.\n\n## 4. Output Pipeline\n\nYou must generate three distinct artifacts in `/home/user/capacity/reports/`. Note that the manager views these files on a Windows workstation, so **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)** line endings are mandatory for text files.\n\n**Artifact A: Intermediate Data**\n*   File: `intermediate.json`\n*   Content: A flat JSON object mapping the metric names (keys: `AVG_CPU_USED`, `AVG_MEM_USED`, `AVG_DISK_USED`) to their calculated integer averages. Use compact formatting (no whitespace/newlines).\n\n**Artifact B: The Summary Report**\n*   File: `summary_202301.log`\n*   Line Endings: **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`).\n*   Content:\n    1.  `AVG_CPU_USED=<val>`\n    2.  `AVG_MEM_USED=<val>`\n    3.  `AVG_DISK_USED=<val>`\n    4.  `source_size=<bytes>` (where `<bytes>` is the exact file size of `intermediate.json` in bytes).\n\n**Artifact C: Binary Checksum**\n*   File: `checksum.bin`\n*   Content: The **raw binary** MD5 digest (16 bytes) of the `summary_202301.log` file. Do not store the hex string; store the actual bytes.\n\n## 5. Finalization\n\n1.  Update the symlink `/home/user/capacity/latest` to point to `summary_202301.log` (absolute path).\n2.  Append a strictly formatted line to `/home/user/capacity/operations.log`:\n    `Publication 2023-01: <N> files, Checksum: <SHA256>`\n    *   `<N>`: Total count of valid files processed.\n    *   `<SHA256>`: The lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the **`checksum.bin`** file you just created.\n    *   (Note: `operations.log` is a standard Linux log, so use standard LF line endings here).\n\n**Constraints**:\n*   No root privileges.\n*   Standard Python 3 libraries are available.\n*   Do not leave stray temporary files.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@5796a375-dbf6-41c9-a2c9-9c12d187c8ad:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
