  "analysis": "Two JSON files have been found in the tickets directory: 'CR-1104-draft.json' and 'CR-1104.json'. Both files appear to be empty (0 bytes), which explains why the email was empty as well. This situation presents a problem because the task requires using a ticket file with specific configuration data, and without content in these files, I cannot extract the necessary values (host, port, password, connection_multiplier, connection_offset, etc.). The presence of a draft file ('CR-1104-draft.json') also adds ambiguity as to which file should be used.",
  "plan": "I will attempt to inspect the contents of both JSON files to see if they contain any data. If they are indeed empty, I will need to report that the required configuration data is missing and request further instructions or the correct ticket file. Given the constraints of the task (no external tools, must use Python 3 with standard library only, and specific file encoding requirements), proceeding without the ticket data is not possible.",
