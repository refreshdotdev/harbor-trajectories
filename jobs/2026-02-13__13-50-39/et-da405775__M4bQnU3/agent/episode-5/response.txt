  "analysis": "Both JSON files ('CR-1104.json' and 'CR-1104-draft.json') are confirmed to be completely empty. This means I do not have access to any of the required configuration data needed to update the files as per the task description. Without the Ticket ID, database connection details, password, connection multiplier, connection offset, server port, or CORS origins, I cannot proceed safely or accurately with any configuration changes.",
  "plan": "Given that both the email and the ticket files are empty, I must conclude that there is missing or corrupted data required to perform this task. I will now check the current state of the configuration files that need updating ('db-service.toml' and 'api-gateway.yaml') to at least understand their existing structure and content. This may provide some clues or baseline information, but without the ticket data, I cannot make the required updates.",
