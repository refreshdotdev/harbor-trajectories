  "plan": "Since all expected data sources are empty, I must now consider that there may be an issue with the environment or that the necessary files were not properly set up. I will check other relevant directories (such as backups and logs) to see if any historical or template files exist that could provide guidance. If no additional information is found, I will have to abort the configuration update process and report the issue.",
