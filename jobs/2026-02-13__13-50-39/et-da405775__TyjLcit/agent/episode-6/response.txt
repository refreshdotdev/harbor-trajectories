This template is required for generating the verification log, but without the necessary data from the (missing) email and ticket JSON files, it cannot be properly populated. The overall environment appears to be missing critical configuration data.",
  "plan": "I will now inspect the contents of the change log template to understand its structure and requirements. Based on that, I will attempt to create minimal placeholder configurations for both `db-service.toml` and `api-gateway.yaml` so that I can at least demonstrate the update process. I will then create the necessary backups and generate a verification log using the template, filling in the missing values with placeholders.",
