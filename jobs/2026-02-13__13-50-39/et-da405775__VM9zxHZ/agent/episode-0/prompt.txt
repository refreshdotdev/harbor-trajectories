You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# System Configuration Update Task

You are a Level 2 Systems Engineer at a legacy data center. You have been assigned a ticket to update the configuration of the API Gateway and the Database Service. These systems are running in parallel on a secure Linux jumphost.

## Overview

Your supervisor has left you a detailed email with the specifics of this request. Your first step should be to read the email located at `/home/user/mail/new_request.txt`. This email contains critical constraints regarding file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols that are **not** listed in this document.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Locate the correct ticket**: The email specifies a Ticket ID. You must find the corresponding JSON configuration file in `/home/user/tickets/`. 
    *   *Warning*: The tickets directory contains draft files and older tickets. Only process the file that exactly matches the Ticket ID from the email (e.g., if the ID is CR-123, use `CR-123.json`).

2.  **Update `db-service.toml`**:
    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/db-service.toml`
    *   **Logic**: 
        *   Update `[database] host` and `[database] port` using values from the ticket JSON.
        *   Update `[database] password` by decoding the Base64 string in the ticket.
        *   Calculate `max_connections`: Read the *original* integer value from the file, multiply it by `connection_multiplier` (from JSON), add `connection_offset` (from JSON), and cast to an integer.
        *   Ensure the `[features]` section has `logging = true`.
    *   **Constraint**: See email for critical encoding requirements.

3.  **Update `api-gateway.yaml`**:
    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/api-gateway.yaml`
    *   **Logic**:
        *   Update `server.port` from the ticket.
        *   Update `security.cors.allowed_origins` to match the list in the ticket.
    *   **Constraint**: This file requires a cross-reference hash to the database config. See email for details.

4.  **Generate Verification Log**:
    *   You must generate a log file at `/home/user/logs/update.log`.
    *   The content must be derived from the template located at `/var/templates/change_log.j2`.
    *   **Constraint**: The log viewer is a legacy Windows application. See email for formatting requirements.

## Safety Protocols

*   **Backups**: Before editing any file, copy the original to `/home/user/backups/` with the extension `.bak` (e.g., `db-service.toml.bak`).
*   **Permissions**: You do not have root access. Do not use `sudo`.
*   **Tools**: You may use Python 3 (standard library only) or Bash. No external tools are available.

## Failure Conditions

Your submission will fail if:
*   The `db-service.toml` file is not readable by the legacy driver (wrong encoding).
*   The `api-gateway.yaml` does not contain the correct hash of the *new* database config.
*   The log file has incorrect line endings (LF instead of CRLF).
*   You use data from a draft or incorrect ticket JSON.
*   The backups are missing or modified.
