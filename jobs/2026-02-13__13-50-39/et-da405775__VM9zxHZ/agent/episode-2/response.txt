  "analysis": "The investigation confirms that mail/new_request.txt is completely empty (0 bytes). The `less` command is not available and `od -c` shows no content. Without the email content, I'm missing critical constraints about file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols that are essential for completing the configuration update task safely and correctly. I need to find an alternative approach to obtain these requirements.",
  "plan": "Since the email file is empty, I will proceed by first examining the tickets directory to understand what Ticket IDs are available. I'll list the JSON files and look for any that might be the correct ticket (avoiding draft files). I'll also check if there are any other mail files or documentation that might contain the necessary constraints. If no alternative information source is found, I'll need to make conservative assumptions based on standard practices while clearly documenting the missing information.",
