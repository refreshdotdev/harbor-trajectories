You have been assigned a ticket to update the configuration of the API Gateway and the Database Service. These systems are running in parallel on a secure Linux jumphost.\n\n## Overview\n\nYour supervisor has left you a detailed email with the specifics of this request. Your first step should be to read the email located at `/home/user/mail/new_request.txt`. This email contains critical constraints regarding file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols that are **not** listed in this document.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1.  **Locate the correct ticket**: The email specifies a Ticket ID. You must find the corresponding JSON configuration file in `/home/user/tickets/`. \n    *   *Warning*: The tickets directory contains draft files and older tickets. Only process the file that exactly matches the Ticket ID from the email (e.g., if the ID is CR-123, use `CR-123.json`).\n\n2.  **Update `db-service.toml`**:\n    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/db-service.toml`\n    *   **Logic**: \n        *   Update `[database] host` and `[database] port` using values from the ticket JSON.\n        *   Update `[database] password` by decoding the Base64 string in the ticket.\n        *   Calculate `max_connections`: Read the *original* integer value from the file, multiply it by `connection_multiplier` (from JSON), add `connection_offset` (from JSON), and cast to an integer.\n        *   Ensure the `[features]` section has `logging = true`.\n    *   **Constraint**: See email for critical encoding requirements.\n\n3.  **Update `api-gateway.yaml`**:\n    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/api-gateway.yaml`\n    *   **Logic**:\n        *   Update `server.port` from the ticket.\n        *   Update `security.cors.allowed_origins` to match the list in the ticket.\n    *   **Constraint**: This file requires a cross-reference hash to the database config. See email for details.\n\n4.  **Generate Verification Log**:\n    *   You must generate a log file at `/home/user/logs/update.log`.\n    *   The content must be derived from the template located at `/var/templates/change_log.j2`.\n    *   **Constraint**: The log viewer is a legacy Windows application. See email for formatting requirements.\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n*   **Backups**: Before editing any file, copy the original to `/home/user/backups/` with the extension `.bak` (e.g., `db-service.toml.bak`).\n*   **Permissions**: You do not have root access. Do not use `sudo`.\n*   **Tools**: You may use Python 3 (standard library only) or Bash. No external tools are available.\n\n## Failure Conditions\n\nYour submission will fail if:\n*   The `db-service.toml` file is not readable by the legacy driver (wrong encoding).\n*   The `api-gateway.yaml` does not contain the correct hash of the *new* database config.\n*   The log file has incorrect line endings (LF instead of CRLF).\n*   You use data from a draft or incorrect ticket JSON.\n*   The backups are missing or modified.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@bd14060a-62db-40b4-91b9-fb1d09bb4563:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# System Configuration Update Task\n\nYou are a Level 2 Systems Engineer at a legacy data center. You have been assigned a ticket to update the configuration of the API Gateway and the Database Service. These systems are running in parallel on a secure Linux jumphost.\n\n## Overview\n\nYour supervisor has left you a detailed email with the specifics of this request. Your first step should be to read the email located at `/home/user/mail/new_request.txt`. This email contains critical constraints regarding file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols that are **not** listed in this document.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1.  **Locate the correct ticket**: The email specifies a Ticket ID. You must find the corresponding JSON configuration file in `/home/user/tickets/`. \n    *   *Warning*: The tickets directory contains draft files and older tickets. Only process the file that exactly matches the Ticket ID from the email (e.g., if the ID is CR-123, use `CR-123.json`).\n\n2.  **Update `db-service.toml`**:\n    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/db-service.toml`\n    *   **Logic**: \n        *   Update `[database] host` and `[database] port` using values from the ticket JSON.\n        *   Update `[database] password` by decoding the Base64 string in the ticket.\n        *   Calculate `max_connections`: Read the *original* integer value from the file, multiply it by `connection_multiplier` (from JSON), add `connection_offset` (from JSON), and cast to an integer.\n        *   Ensure the `[features]` section has `logging = true`.\n    *   **Constraint**: See email for critical encoding requirements.\n\n3.  **Update `api-gateway.yaml`**:\n    *   **Source File**: `/home/user/configs/api-gateway.yaml`\n    *   **Logic**:\n        *   Update `server.port` from the ticket.\n        *   Update `security.cors.allowed_origins` to match the list in the ticket.\n    *   **Constraint**: This file requires a cross-reference hash to the database config. See email for details.\n\n4.  **Generate Verification Log**:\n    *   You must generate a log file at `/home/user/logs/update.log`.\n    *   The content must be derived from the template located at `/var/templates/change_log.j2`.\n    *   **Constraint**: The log viewer is a legacy Windows application. See email for formatting requirements.\n\n## Safety Protocols\n\n*   **Backups**: Before editing any file, copy the original to `/home/user/backups/` with the extension `.bak` (e.g., `db-service.toml.bak`).\n*   **Permissions**: You do not have root access. Do not use `sudo`.\n*   **Tools**: You may use Python 3 (standard library only) or Bash. No external tools are available.\n\n## Failure Conditions\n\nYour submission will fail if:\n*   The `db-service.toml` file is not readable by the legacy driver (wrong encoding).\n*   The `api-gateway.yaml` does not contain the correct hash of the *new* database config.\n*   The log file has incorrect line endings (LF instead of CRLF).\n*   You use data from a draft or incorrect ticket JSON.\n*   The backups are missing or modified.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@bd14060a-62db-40b4-91b9-fb1d09bb4563:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
