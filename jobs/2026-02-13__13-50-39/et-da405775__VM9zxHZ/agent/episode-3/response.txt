  "analysis": "I have examined the tickets directory and found two files: CR-1104-draft.json and CR-1104.json. Based on the naming convention, CR-1104.json appears to be the correct, non-draft ticket file I should use. The mail directory only contains the empty new_request.txt file, confirming there are no other email files available. I must proceed with the ticket processing while making conservative assumptions about the missing constraints, documenting these assumptions clearly.",
  "plan": "I will begin by inspecting the contents of CR-1104.json to understand the available configuration data. Since I'm missing the email constraints, I'll need to make reasonable assumptions: using UTF-8 encoding for text files, LF line endings (converting to CRLF for the Windows log file), and standard TOML/YAML formatting. I'll proceed with updating the database configuration first, creating a backup before modification.",
