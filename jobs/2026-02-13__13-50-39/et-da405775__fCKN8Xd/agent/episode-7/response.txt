Verified email file existence and content (empty).\n2. Checked mail directory for alternative files (none found).\n3. Examined tickets directory and viewed JSON files (both empty).\n4. Created status logs documenting the issues.\n\nIMPACT:\n- Unable to locate correct ticket file as per requirements.\n- Cannot update db-service.toml or api-gateway.yaml configurations.\n- Unable to generate verification log due to missing template data.\n- Safety protocols (backups) cannot be implemented without original files.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n- Supervisor intervention required to provide missing email content.\n- Request clarification on expected Ticket ID and configuration sources.\n- Consider restoring files from backup if available.\n\nSTATUS: Task blocked - awaiting resolution of missing information.\nEOF\n",
