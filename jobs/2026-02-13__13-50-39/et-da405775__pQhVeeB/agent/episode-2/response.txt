  "analysis": "I have confirmed that the email file `/home/user/mail/new_request.txt` exists but is empty (0 bytes). The tickets directory contains two JSON files: `CR-1104-draft.json` and `CR-1104.json`. Based on the warning in the task description to only process the file that exactly matches the Ticket ID from the email, and the instruction to ignore draft files, it appears `CR-1104.json` is the correct ticket file to use. However, without the email content, I'm missing critical details about file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols.",
  "plan": "I will try to inspect the contents of the `CR-1104.json` file to see if it contains the necessary information. Since the email is missing, I'll proceed with this file, assuming it's the intended one. I'll then need to make decisions about the missing constraints based on common practices or by looking for patterns in the JSON data itself.",
