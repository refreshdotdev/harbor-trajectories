The previous engineer left midway through the migration from a local configuration system to a centralized one. Your goal is to generate a structured diagnostic dataset and a human-readable summary report for the host located at `/home/user`.\n\n## Configuration Context\n\nThis host is part of the \"Gamma\" cluster. Unlike the alpha nodes which still use `/home/user/diag_config.conf`, all Gamma nodes have been migrated to the centralized configuration path at `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`. You must ignore any configuration files found in the user's home directory as they are stale decoys. \n\n**Warning:** The centralized configuration management system is legacy software (circa 1999) and saves files using the **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** character set. Attempting to parse this file as UTF-8 will result in errors due to legacy copyright symbols in the header comments.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\nYou must produce two distinct output files based on live system data. The generation order matters because one file references the other.\n\n### 1. The Machine-Readable Data\n\n**Path:** `/home/user/network_data.json`\n**Encoding:** UTF-16LE with Byte Order Mark (BOM)\n\nThis file must be a valid JSON object containing the following keys:\n\n*   `\"timestamp_utc\"`: Current UTC time in ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).\n*   `\"interface_config\"`: An object containing:\n    *   `\"name\"`: The interface name specified in the configuration file variable `NET_IFACE`.\n    *   `\"primary_ip\"`: The first IPv4 address assigned to that interface (do not include CIDR prefix).\n    *   `\"mtu\"`: The integer MTU value of the interface.\n*   `\"connectivity\"`: An object containing:\n    *   `\"gateway_ip\"`: The default gateway address. If multiple exist, choose the one with the lowest metric. If none, `null`.\n    *   `\"active_tcp_flows\"`: Integer count of TCP sockets in the **ESTABLISHED** state only (ignore LISTEN, TIME-WAIT, etc.). Use `ss`.\n    *   `\"ping_jitter_ms\"`: The standard deviation (`mdev`) from a 5-count ping to the target specified in `PING_HOST` (from config). This must be a float rounded to exactly 3 decimal places.\n\n### 2. The Human-Readable Report\n\n**Path:** `/home/user/network_summary.txt`\n**Encoding:** UTF-8 (Standard)\n\nThis file serves as a verification sidecar. It must contain exactly these lines:\n\nLine 1: `GAMMA NODE DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY`\nLine 2: `Generated: <timestamp_utc>` (Must match the JSON timestamp exactly)\nLine 3: `Target Host: <PING_HOST>` (From config)\nLine 4: `Link Status: <UP or DOWN>` (Based on the operstate of `NET_IFACE`)\nLine 5: `Data Hash: <SHA-1 hash>`\n\n**Crucial:** The `Data Hash` in Line 5 must be the **SHA-1** hash of the binary content of the `network_data.json` file you generated. This ensures the integrity of the binary-encoded JSON file.\n\n## Constraints\n\n*   **Permissions:** Both output files must be mode `644`.\n*   **Environment:** Do not hardcode values. The script must dynamically read `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`.\n*   **Robustness:** The JSON file must be strictly valid. A trailing comma will cause ingestion failure. The encoding (UTF-16LE) is mandatory for the Windows-based ingestion service.\n\nWhen both files are present, valid, and consistent (hash matches, timestamps match), the task is complete.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@05337c35-c522-47ca-ac05-5f66601ac207:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I need to generate two output files in /home/user: a UTF-16LE JSON file with specific network diagnostic data, and a UTF-8 text report that references the JSON file's content and timestamp. The key steps will be: 1) Read the configuration from /opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini using ISO-8859-1 encoding, 2) Collect live network data, 3) Generate the JSON file with proper encoding and content, 4) Generate the text report with the required format and SHA-1 hash of the JSON file.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"First, I'll navigate to the /home/user directory. Then I'll create a temporary directory to work in. I'll read the diagnostics.ini file using iconv to handle the ISO-8859-1 encoding and extract the required configuration values (NET_IFACE, PING_HOST). After that, I'll collect the network interface information, default gateway, and TCP connection count. I'll then generate the JSON file with the collected data in UTF-16LE encoding with BOM. Finally, I'll create the text report file with the required lines, including the SHA-1 hash of the JSON file, and set proper permissions on both output files.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd /home/user\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p tmp\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd tmp\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": false\\n}\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1506,\"completion_tokens\":363,\"total_tokens\":1869,\"cost\":0.00034098,\"is_byok\":false,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":0.00034098,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.00019578,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0001452},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0}}}",
