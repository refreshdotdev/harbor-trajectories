  "analysis": "I am starting fresh on the task with no prior commands executed. I need to generate two output files in /home/user: a UTF-16LE JSON file with specific network diagnostic data, and a UTF-8 text report that references the JSON file's content and timestamp. The key steps will be: 1) Read the configuration from /opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini using ISO-8859-1 encoding, 2) Collect live network data, 3) Generate the JSON file with proper encoding and content, 4) Generate the text report with the required format and SHA-1 hash of the JSON file.",
  "plan": "First, I'll navigate to the /home/user directory. Then I'll create a temporary directory to work in. I'll read the diagnostics.ini file using iconv to handle the ISO-8859-1 encoding and extract the required configuration values (NET_IFACE, PING_HOST). After that, I'll collect the network interface information, default gateway, and TCP connection count. I'll then generate the JSON file with the collected data in UTF-16LE encoding with BOM. Finally, I'll create the text report file with the required lines, including the SHA-1 hash of the JSON file, and set proper permissions on both output files.",
