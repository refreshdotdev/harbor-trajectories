It contains two key parameters: NET_IFACE is set to 'lo' (loopback interface) and PING_HOST is set to '127.0.0.1' (localhost). The file appears to be in the expected ISO-8859-1 format, with copyright symbols displaying correctly. The next step is to gather live network data for the 'lo' interface.",
  "plan": "I will now gather network interface details for 'lo', including its primary IP address and MTU value. I'll also determine the default gateway and count active TCP flows in the ESTABLISHED state. Then, I'll perform a 5-count ping test to localhost to calculate the ping jitter. After collecting all data, I'll proceed to generate the JSON file and summary report.",
