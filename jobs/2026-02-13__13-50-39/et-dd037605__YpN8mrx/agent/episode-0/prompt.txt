You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Network Diagnostic & Serialization Task

You are taking over a legacy monitoring node integration task. The previous engineer left midway through the migration from a local configuration system to a centralized one. Your goal is to generate a structured diagnostic dataset and a human-readable summary report for the host located at `/home/user`.

## Configuration Context

This host is part of the "Gamma" cluster. Unlike the alpha nodes which still use `/home/user/diag_config.conf`, all Gamma nodes have been migrated to the centralized configuration path at `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`. You must ignore any configuration files found in the user's home directory as they are stale decoys. 

**Warning:** The centralized configuration management system is legacy software (circa 1999) and saves files using the **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** character set. Attempting to parse this file as UTF-8 will result in errors due to legacy copyright symbols in the header comments.

## Task Requirements

You must produce two distinct output files based on live system data. The generation order matters because one file references the other.

### 1. The Machine-Readable Data

**Path:** `/home/user/network_data.json`
**Encoding:** UTF-16LE with Byte Order Mark (BOM)

This file must be a valid JSON object containing the following keys:

*   `"timestamp_utc"`: Current UTC time in ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).
*   `"interface_config"`: An object containing:
    *   `"name"`: The interface name specified in the configuration file variable `NET_IFACE`.
    *   `"primary_ip"`: The first IPv4 address assigned to that interface (do not include CIDR prefix).
    *   `"mtu"`: The integer MTU value of the interface.
*   `"connectivity"`: An object containing:
    *   `"gateway_ip"`: The default gateway address. If multiple exist, choose the one with the lowest metric. If none, `null`.
    *   `"active_tcp_flows"`: Integer count of TCP sockets in the **ESTABLISHED** state only (ignore LISTEN, TIME-WAIT, etc.). Use `ss`.
    *   `"ping_jitter_ms"`: The standard deviation (`mdev`) from a 5-count ping to the target specified in `PING_HOST` (from config). This must be a float rounded to exactly 3 decimal places.

### 2. The Human-Readable Report

**Path:** `/home/user/network_summary.txt`
**Encoding:** UTF-8 (Standard)

This file serves as a verification sidecar. It must contain exactly these lines:

Line 1: `GAMMA NODE DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY`
Line 2: `Generated: <timestamp_utc>` (Must match the JSON timestamp exactly)
Line 3: `Target Host: <PING_HOST>` (From config)
Line 4: `Link Status: <UP or DOWN>` (Based on the operstate of `NET_IFACE`)
Line 5: `Data Hash: <SHA-1 hash>`

**Crucial:** The `Data Hash` in Line 5 must be the **SHA-1** hash of the binary content of the `network_data.json` file you generated. This ensures the integrity of the binary-encoded JSON file.

## Constraints

*   **Permissions:** Both output files must be mode `644`.
*   **Environment:** Do not hardcode values. The script must dynamically read `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`.
*   **Robustness:** The JSON file must be strictly valid. A trailing comma will cause ingestion failure. The encoding (UTF-16LE) is mandatory for the Windows-based ingestion service.

When both files are present, valid, and consistent (hash matches, timestamps match), the task is complete.
