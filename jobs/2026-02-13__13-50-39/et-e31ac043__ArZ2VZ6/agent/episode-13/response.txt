  "analysis": "Perfect! I have now successfully extracted the `amount` as `150` from `message.txt`. I can see the structure of `message.txt` from the `head` command output: it contains an HTTP POST request with headers and a JSON body `{\"currency\": \"USD\", \"amount\": 150}`.

  "plan": "1. With the correct `X-Correlation-ID` (`88552211-beef-cafe-1337-998877665544`) and `amount` (`150`), I will now re-calculate the encryption passphrase according to Protocol Omega specifications. 2. Reverse the ID: `445566778899-7331-efac-feeb-11225588`. 3. Multiply `amount` by 31: `150 * 31 = 4650`. 4. Concatenate: `445566778899-7331-efac-feeb-11225588-4650`. 5. Encrypt `message.txt` to `payload.encrypted` using AES256 and this passphrase.",
