  "analysis": "The symmetric encryption using GnuPG failed with the message `gpg: symmetric encryption of 'message.txt' failed: File exists`. This error usually means that GnuPG is trying to write its default `.gpg` extension (e.g., `message.txt.gpg`) and a file with that name already exists, or it implies an issue with writing to the specified output file if some other condition is met. I need to ensure the output file `payload.encrypted` does not exist before this command or that GnuPG is instructed to overwrite it, though the latter is less common behavior for this specific error. The task specifies `payload.encrypted` must be the output name, not the default `.gpg`.",
  "plan": "1. First, check if `payload.encrypted` already exists and remove it if necessary. 2. Re-attempt the GnuPG symmetric encryption command. The current command options are correct for specifying the output filename (`-o payload.encrypted`) and using the derived passphrase. If GnuPG is still problematic with this output name despite it being specified, I might need to use a different approach or ensure no other GnuPG process is holding a lock, though that's less likely in this context. Given the error, a simple removal of the target file if it exists should suffice.",
