  "analysis": "Excellent progress! I have successfully imported two PGP public keys from `correspondence.mbox` into the isolated `secure_gnupg` keyring. The keys are:\n1.  `41165DDE50D3DE90F48D7C2BE5EE4F81C4F20C96` (Partner Bank (Legacy))\n2.  `833207F7686632A1A3BB7D2204A579D91DC753C9` (Partner Bank (Omega))\n\nThe next crucial step is to verify the signature on `message.txt` using `message.txt.sig`. This verification will tell me which of these keys (if any) successfully validates the signature. The key that does will be the one I need for the audit log. Protocol Omega recommends using GnuPG's status-fd or colon-delimited output for reliable information extraction. I will use the colon output format.",
  "plan": "1. Verify the `message.txt.sig` against `message.txt` using GnuPG with its colon-delimited output format. 2. Parse the output to extract the signer's full 40-character fingerprint, the signature creation timestamp in UTC ISO 8601 format, and the verification status (`GOODSIG` or `BADSIG`). 3. Based on the verification status, determine the correct signer key.",
