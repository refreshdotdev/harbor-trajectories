  "analysis": "The `payload.encrypted` file was created by GnuPG, but its size is 0 bytes. The SHA256 checksum `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855` corresponds to an empty file. This indicates that the symmetric encryption of `message.txt` did not produce any output content in `payload.encrypted`. This is a problem as the encrypted payload is a key deliverable.",
  "plan": "Investigate the GnuPG symmetric encryption. The command `echo \"$passphrase\" | gpg --batch --yes --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric --passphrase-fd 0 message.txt > payload.encrypted` should produce a non-empty encrypted file. Common reasons for an empty output file in GnuPG could be that GnuPG wrote to stderr and stdout was empty, or the command was subtly incorrect. Let me try a slightly different approach: explicitly specifying output file with `--output` and checking for any error messages by not redirecting stderr initially.",
