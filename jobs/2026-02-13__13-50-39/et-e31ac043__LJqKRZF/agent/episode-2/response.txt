  "analysis": "The isolated GnuPG environment `secure_gnupg` has been created with the correct permissions (700). The next phase is to extract the relevant PGP public key from the `correspondence.mbox` file and import it into this isolated keyring. This involves searching the mbox for PGP public key blocks and then using `gpg --import` within the context of `GNUPGHOME=secure_gnupg`.",
  "plan": "1. Use `gpg` with `GNUPGHOME` set to `./secure_gnupg` to list the current content of the new keyring (should be empty). 2. Search `correspondence.mbox` for PGP public key blocks using `grep`. 3. Import the found key block(s) into the `secure_gnupg` keyring. 4. List the keys in the `secure_gnupg` keyring to confirm successful import.",
