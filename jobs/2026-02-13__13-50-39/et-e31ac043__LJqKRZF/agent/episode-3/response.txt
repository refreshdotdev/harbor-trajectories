  "analysis": "I have successfully imported two PGP public keys from `correspondence.mbox` into the isolated `secure_gnupg` keyring. The keys are 'Partner Bank (Legacy)' with fingerprint `41165DDE50D3DE90F48D7C2BE5EE4F81C4F20C96` and 'Partner Bank (Omega)' with fingerprint `833207F7686632A1A3BB7D2204A579D91DC753C9`. The next step is to verify the signature on `message.txt` using these keys. Based on the key names, the 'Partner Bank (Omega)' key is likely the one intended for 'Protocol Omega', and I will prioritize it for verification.",
  "plan": "1. Set `GNUPGHOME` to `./secure_gnupg`. 2. Use `gpgv` to verify the detached signature `message.txt.sig` against `message.txt`. I will direct the verbose output to a temporary file for parsing, as `gpgv` doesn't offer structured output like `gpg --verify --status-fd` but it outputs key fingerprint and timestamp on a successful verification. I will specifically look for the 'Partner Bank (Omega)' key.",
