  "analysis": "The `gpgv` command output indicates that the signature on `message.txt` was made using RSA key `833207F7686632A1A3BB7D2204A579D91DC753C9` (belonging to 'Partner Bank (Omega)') at 'Fri 13 Feb 2026 03:16:37 PM UTC'. However, `gpgv` failed to verify it because the key `833207F7686632A1A3BB7D2204A579D91DC753C9` is not considered trusted or is not found in the default trusted key list that `gpgv` might be implicitly using from the new keyring. Since we imported this key, it *should* be available. Protocol Omega requires structured audit logging, and for a 'valid' status, the signature must be cryptographically sound. The current `gpgv` output is ambiguous about actual cryptographic validity.",
  "plan": "To get reliable structured output, I will switch to using `gpg --verify` with `--status-fd`, specifically targeting the 'Partner Bank (Omega)' key. This will provide definitive information on the signature's validity (e.g., `GOODSIG`, `BADSIG`, `ERRSIG`). I will parse the status information to accurately determine the verification status and extract the signer's fingerprint and signature timestamp.",
