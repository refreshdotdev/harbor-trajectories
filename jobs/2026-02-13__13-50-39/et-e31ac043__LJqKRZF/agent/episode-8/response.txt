The `gpg_verify_status.txt` file shows `[GNUPG:] GOODSIG` and `[GNUPG:] VALIDSIG` for the key `833207F7686632A1A3BB7D2204A579D91DC753C9`, which corresponds to 'Partner Bank (Omega)'. The signature was made at '2026-02-13 1770995797' (Unix timestamp). The `TRUST_UNDEFINED` warning is expected as the key was just imported and not locally signed, but Protocol Omega requires verification against the correct key, which we have. I have all necessary information to create the `verification_audit.json` file.",
