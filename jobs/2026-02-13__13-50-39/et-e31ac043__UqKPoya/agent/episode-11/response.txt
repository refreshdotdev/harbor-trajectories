  "analysis": "The `gpg --edit-key` session is not responding to standard commands like `quit`, `C-c`, or `help` when prefixed by `Your decision? `. This suggests the `gpg --edit-key` process is either waiting for a very specific input for the `trust` command or has entered an unresponsive state. The initial `gpgv` output did indicate the key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` was used for the signature. I should try to proceed with verification using this key, assuming it's the correct one, by terminating the current stuck process and restarting.",
  "plan": "I will send `Ctrl-C` again to try and break out of this `gpg --edit-key` session. If it's still unresponsive, I'll have to assume the session is stuck and will proceed by setting `GNUPGHOME` and attempting verification directly with the identified key. If that fails, I'll try the other key. For now, I'll try `Ctrl-C`.",
