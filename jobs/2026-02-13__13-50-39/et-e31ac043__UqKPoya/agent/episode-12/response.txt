  "analysis": "The `gpg --edit-key` session remains unresponsive to `Ctrl-C` when prefixed with `Your decision? `. This indicates a problem with the current interactive session. I must break out of this state to continue. I will try a different approach: I will send `Ctrl-D` (End Of File) which often terminates interactive programs.",
  "plan": "I will send `Ctrl-D` to attempt to terminate the `gpg --edit-key` session. If this is successful, I will re-establish the `GNUPGHOME` environment variable and proceed with verifying `message.txt.sig` against `message.txt` using `gpg --verify`, focusing on the key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` which `gpgv` initially indicated.",
