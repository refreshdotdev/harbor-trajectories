I am now back at the shell prompt. The next step is to verify the signature on `message.txt` using this key.",
  "plan": "I will re-export `GNUPGHOME` to ensure it's set correctly for the isolated GnuPG environment. Then, I will use `gpg --verify message.txt.sig message.txt` to verify the signature. I'll capture the output to extract the fingerprint of the signing key and the signature timestamp, which are required for the `verification_audit.json` file.",
