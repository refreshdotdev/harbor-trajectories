The next step is to derive the encryption passphrase from `message.txt` as per Protocol Omega specifications.",
  "plan": "I will extract the `X-Correlation-ID` header and the `amount` field from the JSON payload in `message.txt`. I'll then reverse the ID, multiply the amount by `0x1F` (31), and construct the passphrase. After deriving the passphrase, I'll use `gpgsym` (or `gpg --symmetric` if `gpgsym` is not available) with AES256 to encrypt `message.txt` into `payload.encrypted`. I must ensure `message.txt` remains unmodified.",
