  "analysis": "The `gpg-zip` command failed to extract keys from `correspondence.mbox` because it's deprecated and requires specific usage. No `.asc` files were created, and consequently, `gpg --import` also failed to import any keys. The isolated GnuPG home directory `secure_gnupg` was created, and `GNUPGHOME` is set correctly, but the keyring is currently empty. I need an alternative method to extract PGP keys from the mbox file.",
  "plan": "I will attempt to extract PGP keys from `correspondence.mbox` using `formail` to split the mbox and then `gpg` to process each part. I'll look for blocks starting with `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and pipe them to `gpg --homedir ./secure_gnupg --import`. If this doesn't work, I'll try extracting using `gpgsplit` if available, or `gpg` directly on the mbox file with `--list-packets` to identify key data.",
