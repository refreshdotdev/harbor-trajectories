You have already successfully completed the task in the previous turn and set `"task_complete": true`. All deliverables are present:
1.  `secure_gnupg/` (Directory, mode 700, containing the imported key) - Created and configured.
2.  `verification_audit.json` (Valid JSON, correct schema, accurate data) - Created and verified.
3.  `payload.encrypted` (Symmetrically encrypted file, decryptable with the derived passphrase) - Created and verified.
4.  `archival_manifest.chk` (SHA256 checksum of the encrypted file) - Created and verified.
5.  Original files (`message.txt`, `message.txt.sig`, `correspondence.mbox`) must remain untouched - Verified implicitly as they were inputs and no commands modified them.

The prompt asks if I'm "sure" I want to mark it complete, implying I might have missed something or that it's a final confirmation. Since all conditions are met, the task is indeed complete. The previous response already stands as the final one.
