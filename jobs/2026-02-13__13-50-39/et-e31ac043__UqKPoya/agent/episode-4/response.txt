  "analysis": "I have successfully extracted two PGP public keys (`Partner Bank (Legacy)` and `Partner Bank (Omega)`) from `correspondence.mbox` and imported them into the isolated GnuPG keyring (`secure_gnupg`). The key fingerprints are `D19F9ED93E37FE0DEB2AA52E4A840AE0330D71FD` and `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC`. The next step is to verify the signature on `message.txt` to determine which key is currently valid.",
  "plan": "I will use `gpgv` or `gpg --verify` to verify `message.txt.sig` against `message.txt`. The goal is to identify which of the imported keys successfully validates the signature. The output should provide the fingerprint of the signing key and the signature timestamp.",
