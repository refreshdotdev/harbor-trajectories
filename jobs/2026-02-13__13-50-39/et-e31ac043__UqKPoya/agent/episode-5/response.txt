  "analysis": "The `gpgv` command indicated that the signature was made by the key with fingerprint `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` (Partner Bank (Omega)). However, `gpgv` reported an error: `Can't check signature: No public key`, specifically mentioning `NO_PUBKEY 0EC25A81416512CC`. This suggests an issue with the keyring format or a bug in `gpgv` with KBX keyboxes, despite the key being imported. The `gpg --verify` command also failed. I need to ensure the key is trusted and try verifying again, possibly using standard `gpg` output parsing if status-fd has issues.",
  "plan": "I will try to explicitly trust the key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` using `gpg --edit-key` and then re-attempt verification. If that doesn't resolve the `gpgv` issue, I'll use `gpg --verify` and parse its human-readable output to extract the necessary details for the audit log (fingerprint and timestamp).",
