  "analysis": "I was in the `gpg --edit-key` interactive session and entered `save` prematurely instead of completing the trust setting. I need to exit the `gpg --edit-key` session properly and then retry the verification. The key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` is the likely signer, as indicated by `gpgv`'s earlier output.",
  "plan": "I will first exit the `gpg --edit-key` interactive session by typing `quit`. Then, I will try verifying the signature again using `gpg --verify message.txt.sig message.txt`. I'll capture its full output to parse the fingerprint and timestamp. If this key doesn't work, I'll try the other key `D19F9ED93E37FE0DEB2AA52E4A840AE0330D71FD` for verification.",
