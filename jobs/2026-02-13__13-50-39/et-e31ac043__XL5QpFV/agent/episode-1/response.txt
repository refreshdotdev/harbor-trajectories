  "analysis": "I have successfully navigated to the `/home/user/work/integration/` directory and created the `secure_gnupg` subdirectory with the required 700 permissions. The pre-existing files (`message.txt`, `message.txt.sig`, `correspondence.mbox`) are present. The next step is to extract PGP public keys from `correspondence.mbox` and import them into the isolated GnuPG keyring.",
  "plan": "I will use GnuPG (gpg) to scan the `correspondence.mbox` file for PGP public key blocks and import any found keys into the newly created isolated keyring. I will set the `GNUPGHOME` environment variable to `./secure_gnupg` to ensure all GnuPG operations use this isolated environment. I'll then list the keys imported into this keyring.",
