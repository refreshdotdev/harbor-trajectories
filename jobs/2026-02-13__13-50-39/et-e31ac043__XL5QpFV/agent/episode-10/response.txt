The next and final step is to generate the integrity manifest file `archival_manifest.chk`. This file must contain the SHA256 checksum of the `payload.encrypted` file, followed by two spaces and the filename, matching the standard output format of `sha256sum`.",
  "plan": "I will use the `sha256sum` command on `payload.encrypted` and redirect its output to the `archival_manifest.chk` file. This will create the manifest in the required format. After this, I will perform a final check of all deliverables to ensure they are all present and correctly named in the `/home/user/work/integration/` directory.",
