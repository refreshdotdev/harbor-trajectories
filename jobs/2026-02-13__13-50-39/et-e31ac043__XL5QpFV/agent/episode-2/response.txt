  "analysis": "Two public keys have been successfully imported from `correspondence.mbox` into the isolated GnuPG keyring (`secure_gnupg`): 'Partner Bank (Legacy)' and 'Partner Bank (Omega)'. The next step is to verify the `message.txt` signature using `message.txt.sig` to determine which of these keys is the correct one for the signature. The `GNUPGHOME` is already set to the correct isolated directory.",
  "plan": "I will use `gpgv` to verify the detached signature `message.txt.sig` against `message.txt`. `gpgv` is designed for efficient signature verification and will directly use the keys in the `secure_gnupg` directory. The output will confirm if the signature is valid and identify the signing key.",
