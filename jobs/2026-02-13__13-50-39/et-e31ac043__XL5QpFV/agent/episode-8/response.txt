  "analysis": "The symmetric encryption command ran without an error message, which is a good sign. I will now verify that the `payload.encrypted` file was created successfully. Next, I need to create the `verification_audit.json` file. This file requires the signature status ('valid'), the signer's fingerprint, and the signature timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2023-10-27T14:30:00Z). I have the fingerprint (`A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC`) and the Unix timestamp (1771008660 from `gpg --list-packets`). I need to convert this Unix timestamp to ISO 8601 format.",

Finally, I will use `jq` (if available, otherwise `printf` with careful quoting) to create the `verification_audit.json` file with the correct structure and content.",
