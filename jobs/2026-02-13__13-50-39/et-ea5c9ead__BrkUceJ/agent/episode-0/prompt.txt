You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Database Backup Service Health Check

You are taking over a shift for a reliability engineer who had to leave abruptly. Your task is to perform a manual health check of the internal backup microservice and generate a compliance report.

## 1. Service Initialization

The service script is located at `/opt/backup/service.py`. It is currently stopped.

*   **Startup Constraints:** The service is known to be fragile. It will strictly refuse to start if it detects a "lock file" left over from a previous unclean shutdown in the `/tmp` directory. You must clear this debris before attempting to start it.
*   **Network Configuration:** By default, the script listens on port 8080. However, due to a firewall rule on this host, you **must** configure it to listen on **port 9090**. The script does not accept command-line arguments for the port; you will need to inspect the script code to identify the correct environment variable to set.
*   **Availability:** The service must be listening on `0.0.0.0` and remain running for the duration of your tests.

## 2. Authentication

The API requires an `X-Backup-Token` header for all requests.

*   Your credentials are in `/etc/backup_service/prod.conf`.
*   **Warning:** The configuration file is known to contain trailing or leading whitespace around the key values due to a copy-paste error in the deployment system. You must programmatically trim this whitespace to get the valid token, otherwise the API will reject your requests (403 Forbidden).

## 3. Traffic Generation

Perform exactly **five** HTTP requests using `curl` in this specific order:

1.  `GET /status`
2.  `GET /last-backup`
3.  `GET /list`
4.  `POST /trigger-backup` (send empty JSON body `{}`)
5.  `GET /download/2`

## 4. Compliance Logging (Strict Formatting)

To satisfy the legacy auditing system, you must log every request to `/home/user/audit/traffic.csv`. 

*   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)**. The standard UTF-8 encoding will cause the mainframe ingestion to fail.
*   **Format:** The file must be a standard CSV with a header row.
    `Timestamp,Method,Path,Status,Bytes,MD5`
*   **Timestamp:** Must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` (note the forward slashes) in UTC.
*   **MD5:** The hex MD5 checksum of the response body.

## 5. Final XML Report

Once the traffic generation is complete and the CSV log is finalized, generate an XML summary report at `/home/user/report.xml`.

*   **BOM Requirement:** The file must start with a **UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)** (`\xEF\xBB\xBF`) so that it opens correctly in Windows-based tools.
*   **Content:** The XML must strictly follow this structure, extracting values from the API responses and the log file itself:

    ```xml
    <HealthCheck>
      <Status>[value of "status" field from /status]</Status>
      <LastBackup>[value of "last_backup" field from /last-backup]</LastBackup>
      <ListCount>[number of items in the /list array]</ListCount>
      <Triggered>[value of "triggered" field from /trigger-backup]</Triggered>
      <DownloadMD5>[MD5 of the /download/2 response body]</DownloadMD5>
      <LogChecksum>[SHA256 checksum of the traffic.csv file]</LogChecksum>
    </HealthCheck>
    ```

**Notes:**
*   You do not need root privileges (the `/opt` and `/etc` files are readable, and you have write access to `/home/user`).
*   Use standard GNU core utilities. Python 3 is installed and encouraged for handling the specific encoding and BOM requirements.
*   Do not modify the source code of the service.
