  "analysis": "The service script, when run with `PORT=9090 HOST=0.0.0.0`, starts but then immediately exits. It's not listening on port 9090, and no process is found afterwards. The service is not responding to `curl` requests. `gunicorn` and `waitress` are not installed. This indicates the service script itself has an issue or requires a specific way to run that hasn't been identified yet.",
  "plan": "I need to get some output from the service script to understand why it's failing. I'll try running it again with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` and `PYTHONDEBUG` to see if any Python error messages or warnings are printed. I'll also try to make it run in the foreground for a short duration to catch any immediate errors. If that fails, I'll try to find any simple patterns within the script that might indicate how it's meant to be run, perhaps by looking for Flask application object creation and `run()` calls.",
