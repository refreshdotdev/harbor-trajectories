  "analysis": "The service script (`/opt/backup/service.py`) is still not producing any output, even when run with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` and `PYTHONDEBUG`, and it exits immediately. The `grep` commands for common Flask patterns like `Flask`, `app.run`, or `if __name__ == '__main__'` also yielded no results. This is very unusual. It suggests the script might be empty, corrupted, or written in a way that's not immediately obvious, or it has an error that prevents it from printing anything before exiting.",
  "plan": "I will now try to get a basic view of the script's content. I'll use `file` to determine its type and then use `head` to see the beginning of the file. If `head` shows nothing or very little, I'll use `wc` to check its size and `cat` to see its full (potentially small) content. This will help me understand if the script is truly empty or just not executing in a way that produces visible output.",
