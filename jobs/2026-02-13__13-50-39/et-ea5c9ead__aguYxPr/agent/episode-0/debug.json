Your task is to perform a manual health check of the internal backup microservice and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Service Initialization\n\nThe service script is located at `/opt/backup/service.py`. It is currently stopped.\n\n*   **Startup Constraints:** The service is known to be fragile. It will strictly refuse to start if it detects a \"lock file\" left over from a previous unclean shutdown in the `/tmp` directory. You must clear this debris before attempting to start it.\n*   **Network Configuration:** By default, the script listens on port 8080. However, due to a firewall rule on this host, you **must** configure it to listen on **port 9090**. The script does not accept command-line arguments for the port; you will need to inspect the script code to identify the correct environment variable to set.\n*   **Availability:** The service must be listening on `0.0.0.0` and remain running for the duration of your tests.\n\n## 2. Authentication\n\nThe API requires an `X-Backup-Token` header for all requests.\n\n*   Your credentials are in `/etc/backup_service/prod.conf`.\n*   **Warning:** The configuration file is known to contain trailing or leading whitespace around the key values due to a copy-paste error in the deployment system. You must programmatically trim this whitespace to get the valid token, otherwise the API will reject your requests (403 Forbidden).\n\n## 3. Traffic Generation\n\nPerform exactly **five** HTTP requests using `curl` in this specific order:\n\n1.  `GET /status`\n2.  `GET /last-backup`\n3.  `GET /list`\n4.  `POST /trigger-backup` (send empty JSON body `{}`)\n5.  `GET /download/2`\n\n## 4. Compliance Logging (Strict Formatting)\n\nTo satisfy the legacy auditing system, you must log every request to `/home/user/audit/traffic.csv`. \n\n*   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)**. The standard UTF-8 encoding will cause the mainframe ingestion to fail.\n*   **Format:** The file must be a standard CSV with a header row.\n    `Timestamp,Method,Path,Status,Bytes,MD5`\n*   **Timestamp:** Must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` (note the forward slashes) in UTC.\n*   **MD5:** The hex MD5 checksum of the response body.\n\n## 5. Final XML Report\n\nOnce the traffic generation is complete and the CSV log is finalized, generate an XML summary report at `/home/user/report.xml`.\n\n*   **BOM Requirement:** The file must start with a **UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)** (`\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF`) so that it opens correctly in Windows-based tools.\n*   **Content:** The XML must strictly follow this structure, extracting values from the API responses and the log file itself:\n\n    ```xml\n    <HealthCheck>\n      <Status>[value of \"status\" field from /status]</Status>\n      <LastBackup>[value of \"last_backup\" field from /last-backup]</LastBackup>\n      <ListCount>[number of items in the /list array]</ListCount>\n      <Triggered>[value of \"triggered\" field from /trigger-backup]</Triggered>\n      <DownloadMD5>[MD5 of the /download/2 response body]</DownloadMD5>\n      <LogChecksum>[SHA256 checksum of the traffic.csv file]</LogChecksum>\n    </HealthCheck>\n    ```\n\n**Notes:**\n*   You do not need root privileges (the `/opt` and `/etc` files are readable, and you have write access to `/home/user`).\n*   Use standard GNU core utilities. Python 3 is installed and encouraged for handling the specific encoding and BOM requirements.\n*   Do not modify the source code of the service.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@8410d390-0a8f-4784-93db-229a58dd341b:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
