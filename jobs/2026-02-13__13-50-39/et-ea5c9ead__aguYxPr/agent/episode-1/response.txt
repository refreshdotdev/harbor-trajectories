  "analysis": "The initial checks reveal there is no lock file in /tmp (command exit code 2 indicates no files found, which is good). However, grepping for 'port' and specific port numbers in service.py yielded no output. This suggests that the port configuration might be handled differently, perhaps through a dedicated variable name or it might be hardcoded. I need to inspect the service script more thoroughly to identify how the port is set.",
  "plan": "Carefully read through the service.py script to understand its structure and identify the variable or mechanism used for port configuration. I will also look for any environment variable names that might control the port, and if a default port is hardcoded, I will note it down for later configuration.",
