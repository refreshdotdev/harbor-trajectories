Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Database Backup Service Health Check\n\nYou are taking over a shift for a reliability engineer who had to leave abruptly. Your task is to perform a manual health check of the internal backup microservice and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Service Initialization\n\nThe service script is located at `/opt/backup/service.py`. It is currently stopped.\n\n*   **Startup Constraints:** The service is known to be fragile. It will strictly refuse to start if it detects a \"lock file\" left over from a previous unclean shutdown in the `/tmp` directory. You must clear this debris before attempting to start it.\n*   **Network Configuration:** By default, the script listens on port 8080. However, due to a firewall rule on this host, you **must** configure it to listen on **port 9090**. The script does not accept command-line arguments for the port; you will need to inspect the script code to identify the correct environment variable to set.\n*   **Availability:** The service must be listening on `0.0.0.0` and remain running for the duration of your tests.\n\n## 2. Authentication\n\nThe API requires an `X-Backup-Token` header for all requests.\n\n*   Your credentials are in `/etc/backup_service/prod.conf`.\n*   **Warning:** The configuration file is known to contain trailing or leading whitespace around the key values due to a copy-paste error in the deployment system. You must programmatically trim this whitespace to get the valid token, otherwise the API will reject your requests (403 Forbidden).\n\n## 3. Traffic Generation\n\nPerform exactly **five** HTTP requests using `curl` in this specific order:\n\n1.  `GET /status`\n2.  `GET /last-backup`\n3.  `GET /list`\n4.  `POST /trigger-backup` (send empty JSON body `{}`)\n5.  `GET /download/2`\n\n## 4. Compliance Logging (Strict Formatting)\n\nTo satisfy the legacy auditing system, you must log every request to `/home/user/audit/traffic.csv`. \n\n*   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)**. The standard UTF-8 encoding will cause the mainframe ingestion to fail.\n*   **Format:** The file must be a standard CSV with a header row.\n    `Timestamp,Method,Path,Status,Bytes,MD5`\n*   **Timestamp:** Must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` (note the forward slashes) in UTC.\n*   **MD5:** The hex MD5 checksum of the response body.\n\n## 5. Final XML Report\n\nOnce the traffic generation is complete and the CSV log is finalized, generate an XML summary report at `/home/user/report.xml`.\n\n*   **BOM Requirement:** The file must start with a **UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)** (`\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF`) so that it opens correctly in Windows-based tools.\n*   **Content:** The XML must strictly follow this structure, extracting values from the API responses and the log file itself:\n\n    ```xml\n    <HealthCheck>\n      <Status>[value of \"status\" field from /status]</Status>\n      <LastBackup>[value of \"last_backup\" field from /last-backup]</LastBackup>\n      <ListCount>[number of items in the /list array]</ListCount>\n      <Triggered>[value of \"triggered\" field from /trigger-backup]</Triggered>\n      <DownloadMD5>[MD5 of the /download/2 response body]</DownloadMD5>\n      <LogChecksum>[SHA256 checksum of the traffic.csv file]</LogChecksum>\n    </HealthCheck>\n    ```\n\n**Notes:**\n*   You do not need root privileges (the `/opt` and `/etc` files are readable, and you have write access to `/home/user`).\n*   Use standard GNU core utilities. Python 3 is installed and encouraged for handling the specific encoding and BOM requirements.\n*   Do not modify the source code of the service.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@8410d390-0a8f-4784-93db-229a58dd341b:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Database Backup Service Health Check\n\nYou are taking over a shift for a reliability engineer who had to leave abruptly. Your task is to perform a manual health check of the internal backup microservice and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Service Initialization\n\nThe service script is located at `/opt/backup/service.py`. It is currently stopped.\n\n*   **Startup Constraints:** The service is known to be fragile. It will strictly refuse to start if it detects a \"lock file\" left over from a previous unclean shutdown in the `/tmp` directory. You must clear this debris before attempting to start it.\n*   **Network Configuration:** By default, the script listens on port 8080. However, due to a firewall rule on this host, you **must** configure it to listen on **port 9090**. The script does not accept command-line arguments for the port; you will need to inspect the script code to identify the correct environment variable to set.\n*   **Availability:** The service must be listening on `0.0.0.0` and remain running for the duration of your tests.\n\n## 2. Authentication\n\nThe API requires an `X-Backup-Token` header for all requests.\n\n*   Your credentials are in `/etc/backup_service/prod.conf`.\n*   **Warning:** The configuration file is known to contain trailing or leading whitespace around the key values due to a copy-paste error in the deployment system. You must programmatically trim this whitespace to get the valid token, otherwise the API will reject your requests (403 Forbidden).\n\n## 3. Traffic Generation\n\nPerform exactly **five** HTTP requests using `curl` in this specific order:\n\n1.  `GET /status`\n2.  `GET /last-backup`\n3.  `GET /list`\n4.  `POST /trigger-backup` (send empty JSON body `{}`)\n5.  `GET /download/2`\n\n## 4. Compliance Logging (Strict Formatting)\n\nTo satisfy the legacy auditing system, you must log every request to `/home/user/audit/traffic.csv`. \n\n*   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)**. The standard UTF-8 encoding will cause the mainframe ingestion to fail.\n*   **Format:** The file must be a standard CSV with a header row.\n    `Timestamp,Method,Path,Status,Bytes,MD5`\n*   **Timestamp:** Must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` (note the forward slashes) in UTC.\n*   **MD5:** The hex MD5 checksum of the response body.\n\n## 5. Final XML Report\n\nOnce the traffic generation is complete and the CSV log is finalized, generate an XML summary report at `/home/user/report.xml`.\n\n*   **BOM Requirement:** The file must start with a **UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)** (`\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF`) so that it opens correctly in Windows-based tools.\n*   **Content:** The XML must strictly follow this structure, extracting values from the API responses and the log file itself:\n\n    ```xml\n    <HealthCheck>\n      <Status>[value of \"status\" field from /status]</Status>\n      <LastBackup>[value of \"last_backup\" field from /last-backup]</LastBackup>\n      <ListCount>[number of items in the /list array]</ListCount>\n      <Triggered>[value of \"triggered\" field from /trigger-backup]</Triggered>\n      <DownloadMD5>[MD5 of the /download/2 response body]</DownloadMD5>\n      <LogChecksum>[SHA256 checksum of the traffic.csv file]</LogChecksum>\n    </HealthCheck>\n    ```\n\n**Notes:**\n*   You do not need root privileges (the `/opt` and `/etc` files are readable, and you have write access to `/home/user`).\n*   Use standard GNU core utilities. Python 3 is installed and encouraged for handling the specific encoding and BOM requirements.\n*   Do not modify the source code of the service.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@8410d390-0a8f-4784-93db-229a58dd341b:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Database Backup Service Health Check\n\nYou are taking over a shift for a reliability engineer who had to leave abruptly. Your task is to perform a manual health check of the internal backup microservice and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Service Initialization\n\nThe service script is located at `/opt/backup/service.py`. It is currently stopped.\n\n*   **Startup Constraints:** The service is known to be fragile. It will strictly refuse to start if it detects a \"lock file\" left over from a previous unclean shutdown in the `/tmp` directory. You must clear this debris before attempting to start it.\n*   **Network Configuration:** By default, the script listens on port 8080. However, due to a firewall rule on this host, you **must** configure it to listen on **port 9090**. The script does not accept command-line arguments for the port; you will need to inspect the script code to identify the correct environment variable to set.\n*   **Availability:** The service must be listening on `0.0.0.0` and remain running for the duration of your tests.\n\n## 2. Authentication\n\nThe API requires an `X-Backup-Token` header for all requests.\n\n*   Your credentials are in `/etc/backup_service/prod.conf`.\n*   **Warning:** The configuration file is known to contain trailing or leading whitespace around the key values due to a copy-paste error in the deployment system. You must programmatically trim this whitespace to get the valid token, otherwise the API will reject your requests (403 Forbidden).\n\n## 3. Traffic Generation\n\nPerform exactly **five** HTTP requests using `curl` in this specific order:\n\n1.  `GET /status`\n2.  `GET /last-backup`\n3.  `GET /list`\n4.  `POST /trigger-backup` (send empty JSON body `{}`)\n5.  `GET /download/2`\n\n## 4. Compliance Logging (Strict Formatting)\n\nTo satisfy the legacy auditing system, you must log every request to `/home/user/audit/traffic.csv`. \n\n*   **Encoding:** The file **must** be encoded in **Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)**. The standard UTF-8 encoding will cause the mainframe ingestion to fail.\n*   **Format:** The file must be a standard CSV with a header row.\n    `Timestamp,Method,Path,Status,Bytes,MD5`\n*   **Timestamp:** Must be in the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss` (note the forward slashes) in UTC.\n*   **MD5:** The hex MD5 checksum of the response body.\n\n## 5. Final XML Report\n\nOnce the traffic generation is complete and the CSV log is finalized, generate an XML summary report at `/home/user/report.xml`.\n\n*   **BOM Requirement:** The file must start with a **UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)** (`\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF`) so that it opens correctly in Windows-based tools.\n*   **Content:** The XML must strictly follow this structure, extracting values from the API responses and the log file itself:\n\n    ```xml\n    <HealthCheck>\n      <Status>[value of \"status\" field from /status]</Status>\n      <LastBackup>[value of \"last_backup\" field from /last-backup]</LastBackup>\n      <ListCount>[number of items in the /list array]</ListCount>\n      <Triggered>[value of \"triggered\" field from /trigger-backup]</Triggered>\n      <DownloadMD5>[MD5 of the /download/2 response body]</DownloadMD5>\n      <LogChecksum>[SHA256 checksum of the traffic.csv file]</LogChecksum>\n    </HealthCheck>\n    ```\n\n**Notes:**\n*   You do not need root privileges (the `/opt` and `/etc` files are readable, and you have write access to `/home/user`).\n*   Use standard GNU core utilities. Python 3 is installed and encouraged for handling the specific encoding and BOM requirements.\n*   Do not modify the source code of the service.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@8410d390-0a8f-4784-93db-229a58dd341b:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
