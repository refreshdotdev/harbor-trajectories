More restrictive levels (\u201cWARN\u201d, \u201cERROR\u201d, \u201cFATAL\u201d) are also acceptable. Anything more verbose (e.g. \u201cDEBUG\u201d, \u201cTRACE\u201d) is non-compliant.\n    c.  **Network**: In section `[network]`, the key `trusted_hosts` (if present) must contain **only** hostnames ending in `.corp.local`. The value is a comma-separated list. You must remove any non-compliant hostnames. If the list becomes empty, set the value to empty. If the key or section is missing, do not add it.\n\n3.

Produce a single human-readable remediation log at `/home/user/policy/reports/after_remediation.log`.\n    The file must be created (and overwritten if it exists).
