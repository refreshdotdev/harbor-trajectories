You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are an on–call operations engineer who has been paged because “some internal and public hostnames are not resolving for application pods”. There is a **mock** name-service setup under your non-privileged account. Your task is to triage the incident and leave an auditable trail of what you did.

### INPUT MATERIAL (already present in the home directory)
*   `/home/user/incidents/tickets/dns_incident_2024.txt`
    *   ASCII text, one hostname per line, no blank lines.
*   `/home/user/resources/mock_hosts`
    *   Works exactly like the traditional /etc/hosts file.
    *   Fields are whitespace-separated.
*   `/home/user/resources/dns/internal_dns.json`
    *   **Primary** DNS source. JSON object.
*   `/home/user/resources/dns/external_dns.json`
    *   **Secondary** DNS source. JSON object.

**DNS JSON Format:**
Keys are hostnames. Values are objects containing either:
*   `"A"` and `"AAAA"` keys (IP addresses).
*   **OR** a `"CNAME"` key (alias to another hostname).

### WHAT YOU MUST DO
1.  **Read Hostnames**: Read every hostname from the ticket file.

2.  **Resolution Logic**: For each hostname, determine its status:
    *   **Check `mock_hosts`**: Look up the hostname here first.
    *   **Check DNS**: If the hostname is not in `mock_hosts` (or to verify consistency), resolve it using the JSON files.
        *   **Precedence**: Look in `internal_dns.json` first. If not found, look in `external_dns.json`.
        *   **CNAMEs**: If a record contains a `"CNAME"` key, you must recursively resolve the target hostname using the same DNS precedence rules. Support a maximum recursion depth of **3**. If the chain exceeds 3 or loops, treat it as "no record".
        *   **Result**: The final resolution is the `"A"` and `"AAAA"` values of the final target.

3.  **Update Hosts File**: If a hostname has **no entry** in `mock_hosts` but **does** resolve to a non-empty IPv4 (`"A"`) via DNS (after following any CNAMEs), append a new line to `/home/user/resources/mock_hosts`:
    `<Resolved_IPv4><tab><Original_Hostname>`

4.  **Generate Report**: Produce a **sorted** tab-separated log file `/home/user/incidents/dns_resolution_report.log`.
    *   **Sorting**: The lines must be sorted alphabetically by `HOSTNAME`.
    *   **Columns** (Tab-separated):
        1.  `HOSTNAME` (from ticket)
        2.  `HOSTS_FILE_IP` (IP from `mock_hosts` or “-”)
        3.  `DNS_IPV4` (Resolved “A” from JSON or “-”)
        4.  `DNS_IPV6` (Resolved “AAAA” from JSON or “-”)
        5.  `SUMMARY` (Exact phrase required):
            *   `OK - hosts entry present, no DNS` (In hosts, not in DNS)
            *   `OK - consistent` (In hosts and DNS, IPv4 matches)
            *   `WARN - inconsistent` (In hosts and DNS, but IPv4 differs)
            *   `UPDATED hosts with DNS A` (Not in hosts, found in DNS)
            *   `NO RECORD FOUND` (In neither)

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
*   Log file exists, is UTF-8, and permissions are `0640` (rw-r-----).
*   Log file content is **sorted alphabetically** by hostname.
*   `mock_hosts` is updated correctly with resolved IPs for new hosts.
*   CNAME chains are followed correctly to find the final IP.
*   Internal DNS takes precedence over External DNS.
*   The `WARN - inconsistent` state is correctly identified.

### IMPORTANT
*   Use only the provided files. Do not query real DNS.
*   Do not modify the JSON files.
*   Do not use root privileges.
