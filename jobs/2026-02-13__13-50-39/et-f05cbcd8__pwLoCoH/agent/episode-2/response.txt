  "analysis": "The directory structure and files are confirmed. However, the 'dns_incident_2024.txt', 'mock_hosts', 'internal_dns.json', and 'external_dns.json' files appear to be empty or contain no data in the first few lines, as 'head' commands produced no output. This is unexpected for a DNS incident triage task. The next step is to verify the exact status of these files by checking their sizes and attempting to read their full content.",
  "plan": "1. Use 'wc -l' to count the number of lines in 'dns_incident_2024.txt' to confirm if it's empty or not. 2. Use 'cat' to display the full content of 'dns_incident_2024.txt', 'mock_hosts', 'internal_dns.json', and 'external_dns.json' to see their complete contents. This will clarify whether the files are truly empty or if they contain data that 'head' missed.",
