  "analysis": "The jq command failed to parse the numeric values due to encoding issues with the Euro symbol (€). The error message indicates jq encountered 'â¬145.75' instead of the expected numeric value. This suggests that the iconv conversion didn't handle the currency symbol properly or the jq substitution pattern needs adjustment.",
  "plan": "I'll first examine the raw data file to understand the exact encoding of the currency symbols. Then I'll modify the jq command to properly handle the currency symbol conversion, and create the normalized JSON file. After that, I'll generate the batch ID from the properly formatted JSON file.",
