The previous engineer left abruptly. We have a raw dump of weekly cloud costs, but the data pipeline needs to be reconstructed to support both our modern dashboard (JSON) and the legacy banking mainframe (CSV).\n\n**Input Data & Environment**\n*   **Raw Data**: Located at `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`. \n    *   *Warning*: This file comes from the legacy scrape tool. It is **NOT** UTF-8. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). You must handle this encoding correctly or the currency symbols will be corrupted.\n*   **Exchange Rates**: \n    *   There is a config file at `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/exchange_rates.json`. **IGNORE THIS FILE.** It contains Q1 rates and will cause financial discrepancies. \n    *   The authoritative rates are provided by the Finance team in a CSV file located at `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`.\n*   **Blocked Accounts**: `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/blocked_accounts.txt`. Accounts listed here must be excluded. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored.\n\n**Required Artefacts**\n\nYou must generate exactly four files in `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/`. The pipeline is strictly sequential.\n\n### Step 1: Normalization\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/normalized_data.json`.\n*   Read the raw ISO-8859-1 data and save it as standard **UTF-8** JSON.\n*   Ensure all monetary values are numbers, not strings.\n*   This file serves as the \"source of truth\" for the downstream steps.\n\n### Step 2: Audit Checkpoint\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/batch_id.txt`.\n*   To ensure data lineage, calculate the **SHA256 checksum** of the `normalized_data.json` file generated in Step 1.\n*   The file must contain *only* the hex digest string (64 characters), with no trailing newline or whitespace.\n\n### Step 3: High Spend Filtering\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/high_spend.json`.\n*   **Conversion**: Convert all costs to USD using the rates from `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`. If a currency is missing from the CSV, default to 1.0.\n*   **Thresholding**: We no longer use a fixed $1000 threshold. Calculate the **statistical median** of the *converted USD costs* for the entire dataset (after filtering blocked accounts). A record is \"High Spend\" if its USD cost is strictly **greater than** this median value.\n*   **Content**: The JSON array should contain the original objects plus two new fields:\n    *   `cost_in_usd`: The converted amount (float, rounded to 2 decimal places).\n    *   `batch_id`: The hash calculated in Step 2.\n*   **Format**: UTF-8, pretty-printed (2 spaces).\n\n### Step 4: Mainframe Export\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/summary.csv`.\n*   This file is ingested by the OMNI-7 mainframe.\n*   **Encoding Constraint**: The mainframe does not support UTF-8. This file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1**.\n*   **Header**: `ACCOUNT_ID,USD_COST,Original_Currency` (Case sensitive).\n*   **Rows**: Only the High Spend records, sorted by `USD_COST` descending.\n*   **Formatting**: `USD_COST` must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n**Validation**\nFinally, write `Validation successful` to `/home/user/cloud_costs/logs/validation.log` only if all steps complete without error.\n\n**Summary of traps to avoid:**\n*   Do not read the wrong rates file.\n*   Do not assume the raw input is UTF-8.\n*   Do not output UTF-8 for the CSV file.\n*   Do not use a hardcoded threshold; calculate the median.\n*   Ensure the `batch_id` in the JSON matches the checksum file exactly.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@12cf2d23-34f2-4d5e-9579-2b81a6b81d1c:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
