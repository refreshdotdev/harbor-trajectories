The finance rates CSV at /var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv is also empty. This means I cannot proceed with the data migration pipeline as there's no input data to process.",

I'll create the processed directory structure as specified, then write an error message to the validation log indicating that the pipeline cannot run due to missing input data. This will formally document why the required artifacts cannot be generated.",
