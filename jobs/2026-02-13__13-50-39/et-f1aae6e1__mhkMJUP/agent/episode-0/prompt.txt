You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Task: FinOps Q3 Data Migration & Mainframe Feed

**Context**
You are a backend engineer tasked with fixing the broken cost reporting pipeline for Q3. The previous engineer left abruptly. We have a raw dump of weekly cloud costs, but the data pipeline needs to be reconstructed to support both our modern dashboard (JSON) and the legacy banking mainframe (CSV).

**Input Data & Environment**
*   **Raw Data**: Located at `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`. 
    *   *Warning*: This file comes from the legacy scrape tool. It is **NOT** UTF-8. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). You must handle this encoding correctly or the currency symbols will be corrupted.
*   **Exchange Rates**: 
    *   There is a config file at `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/exchange_rates.json`. **IGNORE THIS FILE.** It contains Q1 rates and will cause financial discrepancies. 
    *   The authoritative rates are provided by the Finance team in a CSV file located at `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`.
*   **Blocked Accounts**: `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/blocked_accounts.txt`. Accounts listed here must be excluded. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored.

**Required Artefacts**

You must generate exactly four files in `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/`. The pipeline is strictly sequential.

### Step 1: Normalization
Create `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/normalized_data.json`.
*   Read the raw ISO-8859-1 data and save it as standard **UTF-8** JSON.
*   Ensure all monetary values are numbers, not strings.
*   This file serves as the "source of truth" for the downstream steps.

### Step 2: Audit Checkpoint
Create `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/batch_id.txt`.
*   To ensure data lineage, calculate the **SHA256 checksum** of the `normalized_data.json` file generated in Step 1.
*   The file must contain *only* the hex digest string (64 characters), with no trailing newline or whitespace.

### Step 3: High Spend Filtering
Create `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/high_spend.json`.
*   **Conversion**: Convert all costs to USD using the rates from `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`. If a currency is missing from the CSV, default to 1.0.
*   **Thresholding**: We no longer use a fixed $1000 threshold. Calculate the **statistical median** of the *converted USD costs* for the entire dataset (after filtering blocked accounts). A record is "High Spend" if its USD cost is strictly **greater than** this median value.
*   **Content**: The JSON array should contain the original objects plus two new fields:
    *   `cost_in_usd`: The converted amount (float, rounded to 2 decimal places).
    *   `batch_id`: The hash calculated in Step 2.
*   **Format**: UTF-8, pretty-printed (2 spaces).

### Step 4: Mainframe Export
Create `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/summary.csv`.
*   This file is ingested by the OMNI-7 mainframe.
*   **Encoding Constraint**: The mainframe does not support UTF-8. This file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1**.
*   **Header**: `ACCOUNT_ID,USD_COST,Original_Currency` (Case sensitive).
*   **Rows**: Only the High Spend records, sorted by `USD_COST` descending.
*   **Formatting**: `USD_COST` must be formatted to 2 decimal places.

**Validation**
Finally, write `Validation successful` to `/home/user/cloud_costs/logs/validation.log` only if all steps complete without error.

**Summary of traps to avoid:**
*   Do not read the wrong rates file.
*   Do not assume the raw input is UTF-8.
*   Do not output UTF-8 for the CSV file.
*   Do not use a hardcoded threshold; calculate the median.
*   Ensure the `batch_id` in the JSON matches the checksum file exactly.
