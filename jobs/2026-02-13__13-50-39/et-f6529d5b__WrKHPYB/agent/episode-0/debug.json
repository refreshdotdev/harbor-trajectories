The auditors use a legacy mainframe system to verify these logs, so adherence to specific binary formats and encoding standards is critical.\n\n**The Source Material**\nAll artifacts are located in `/home/user/source_files/`. The directory contains a mixture of production files, documentation, temporary data, and symbolic links. \n\n**Filtering & Selection Logic**\nWe only audit \"valid\" release artifacts. A file is considered a valid artifact if it meets the following criteria:\n1. It is a **text file** (ends in `.txt`), regardless of size.\n2. OR, it is any other regular file larger than or equal to **1024 bytes** (1KB).\n3. **Symbolic links** must be followed. If a symlink points to a valid artifact (based on the target's properties), treat the symlink itself as the artifact (record the symlink's name, but hash the target's contents). Ignore broken symlinks.\n4. Explicitly **exclude** any hidden files (starting with `.`) and any subdirectories.\n\n**Task A: The Audit Log**\nCreate a directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` (mode 0700). Inside, generate a log file named `checksum_audit.log`.\n\n*   **Encoding**: The auditors' mainframe strictly requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for this file. This is crucial because some filenames may contain accented characters.\n*   **Sorting**: The file records must be sorted by filename using standard **ASCII collation** (i.e., the `C` locale sorting order), not the default UTF-8 dictionary sort.\n*   **Content Format**: The log must follow this strict template:\n\n    ```text\n    START       : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    START_TIME  : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n\n    FILE_RECORDS\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    ...\n\n    END_TIME    : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n    END         : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    ```\n\n    *   Use exactly one space after the filename, and two spaces between the SHA256 and MD5 fields.\n    *   The file must end with a newline.\n\n**Task B: The JSON Summary**\nGenerate a summary file at `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json`. Unlike the log, this file must be **UTF-8** encoded. It should contain:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"period\": \"2023-Q4\",\n  \"file_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer sum of file sizes>,\n  \"start_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"end_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"log_checksum\": \"<SHA-256 hex of the checksum_audit.log content>\",\n  \"signature\": \"<HMAC-SHA256 hex signature>\"\n}\n```\n\n*   **`log_checksum`**: Compute the SHA-256 hash of the `checksum_audit.log` file exactly as it exists at this stage (before the verification line is appended).\n*   **`signature`**: Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the `checksum_audit.log` content (same content as above). \n    *   **Key Derivation**: The secret key is the content of `/home/user/source_files/.secret` (strip all whitespace/newlines) **concatenated with the current UTC date** in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., if the secret is `abc` and date is Oct 27 2023, the key is `abc20231027`).\n\n**Task C: Integrity Verification**\n1.  After writing the JSON summary, perform a read-back verification of the `checksum_audit.log`.\n2.  Parse the log (remember it is ISO-8859-1) and verify that every listed SHA-256 hash matches the actual file on disk.\n3.  Append a final status line to `checksum_audit.log` (also in ISO-8859-1): either `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED`.\n\n**Deliverables**\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log` (ISO-8859-1)\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json` (UTF-8)\n\nNote: The grading system will verify the exact byte sequence of the log file to ensure correct encoding of special characters.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@34f88313-0823-4ada-8ebe-7f4137319728:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

No prior commands related to the audit task have been executed. The source files directory `/home/user/source_files/` and the secret file `/home/user/source_files/.secret` must exist and be accessible. The task requires creating the audit directory, generating a log file with specific encoding and format, and creating a JSON summary file.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"1. First, I need to ensure the source files directory and the secret file exist. I'll check for them. 2. Then, I'll create the audit directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` with the required permissions (0700). 3. Next, I'll generate an ISO-8601 timestamp for the start of the audit. 4. I will then write the header of `checksum_audit.log` using ISO-8859-1 encoding, including the start time. 5. I'll set up the locale to 'C' for ASCII sorting. 6. I will find all valid artifacts in `/home/user/source_files/` based on the specified criteria (text files regardless of size, other regular files >= 1KB, follow symlinks but ignore broken ones, exclude hidden files and subdirectories). 7. I'll process these files: for each, I'll determine its filename to record, get its actual file path (following symlinks), calculate SHA256 and MD5 hashes of its content, and record its size. 8. I'll sort the file records by filename using ASCII collation. 9. I'll append the formatted file records to `checksum_audit.log`. 10. I'll append the footer to `checksum_audit.log` with a placeholder for the end time. 11. I'll compute the SHA-256 hash of the log content *before* the final verification status is appended. 12. I'll read the secret key from `.secret`, strip whitespace/newlines, and concatenate it with the current UTC date in YYYYMMDD format to form the HMAC key. 13. I'll compute the HMAC-SHA256 signature of the log content (same content as for the checksum). 14. I'll create the `summary.json` file in UTF-8 encoding, populating all fields including the log checksum and signature calculated. 15. I'll complete the `checksum_audit.log` by appending the actual end time and the verification status line (initially VERIFICATION_PENDING). 16. Finally, I'll perform the integrity verification by re-reading the log, re-calculating hashes for each listed file, and updating the final status line in `checksum_audit.log`.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"ls -la /home/user/source_files/\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 1.0\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -m 0700 /home/user/audit_2023Q4\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"export AUDIT_START_TS=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"echo \\\\\\\"START       : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\\\\\\\" > /home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"echo \\\\\\\"START_TIME  : ${AUDIT_START_TS}\\\\\\\" >> /home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"echo \\\\\\\"FILE_RECORDS\\\\\\\" >> /home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\",\"refusal\":null,\"reasoning\":null}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":1669,\"completion_tokens\":821,\"total_tokens\":2490,\"cost\":0.00054537,\"is_byok\":false,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0},\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":0.00054537,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.00021697,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0003284},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0}}}",
