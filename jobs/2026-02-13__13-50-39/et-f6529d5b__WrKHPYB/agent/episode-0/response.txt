  "analysis": "The current terminal is at `/home/user` with root privileges. No prior commands related to the audit task have been executed. The source files directory `/home/user/source_files/` and the secret file `/home/user/source_files/.secret` must exist and be accessible. The task requires creating the audit directory, generating a log file with specific encoding and format, and creating a JSON summary file.",
  "plan": "1. First, I need to ensure the source files directory and the secret file exist. I'll check for them. 2. Then, I'll create the audit directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` with the required permissions (0700). 3. Next, I'll generate an ISO-8601 timestamp for the start of the audit. 4. I will then write the header of `checksum_audit.log` using ISO-8859-1 encoding, including the start time. 5. I'll set up the locale to 'C' for ASCII sorting. 6. I will find all valid artifacts in `/home/user/source_files/` based on the specified criteria (text files regardless of size, other regular files >= 1KB, follow symlinks but ignore broken ones, exclude hidden files and subdirectories). 7. I'll process these files: for each, I'll determine its filename to record, get its actual file path (following symlinks), calculate SHA256 and MD5 hashes of its content, and record its size. 8. I'll sort the file records by filename using ASCII collation. 9. I'll append the formatted file records to `checksum_audit.log`. 10. I'll append the footer to `checksum_audit.log` with a placeholder for the end time. 11. I'll compute the SHA-256 hash of the log content *before* the final verification status is appended. 12. I'll read the secret key from `.secret`, strip whitespace/newlines, and concatenate it with the current UTC date in YYYYMMDD format to form the HMAC key. 13. I'll compute the HMAC-SHA256 signature of the log content (same content as for the checksum). 14. I'll create the `summary.json` file in UTF-8 encoding, populating all fields including the log checksum and signature calculated. 15. I'll complete the `checksum_audit.log` by appending the actual end time and the verification status line (initially VERIFICATION_PENDING). 16. Finally, I'll perform the integrity verification by re-reading the log, re-calculating hashes for each listed file, and updating the final status line in `checksum_audit.log`.",
