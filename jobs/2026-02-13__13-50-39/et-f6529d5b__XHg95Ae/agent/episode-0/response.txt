  "analysis": "The current working directory is `/home/user`, and no prior work related to the audit task has been done. The task requires setting up a directory structure, filtering files from `/home/user/source_files/` based on specific criteria, generating a strictly formatted log file with ISO-8859-1 encoding and C-locale sorting, and then creating a JSON summary with UTF-8 encoding. The process also involves hashing files and performing integrity verification.",
  "plan": "First, we'll set up the audit directory with the correct permissions. Then, we'll navigate to the source files and prepare shell scripts to handle the complex file filtering, hashing, and log generation logic. This includes defining a C-locale environment for sorting and ensuring ISO-8859-1 encoding for the log file. Finally, we'll generate the JSON summary, compute the necessary HMAC signature, and perform the integrity verification by re-reading and re-hashing the log file.",
