At this point, the `checksum_audit.log` file should have been generated in `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/` with the header and file records in ISO-8859-1 encoding and sorted using the C-locale. The next step is to verify the log file's content and prepare for generating the JSON summary.",
  "plan": "First, we will examine the content of the generated log file to ensure it meets the format requirements. Then, we will write a script to generate the JSON summary. This script will: 1) Read the log file (handling ISO-8859-1 encoding). 2) Extract necessary information such as file count and total bytes. 3) Compute the SHA-256 hash of the log file (before the final verification line is added). 4) Derive an HMAC-SHA256 signature using the secret key from `/home/user/source_files/.secret` concatenated with the current UTC date. 5) Write the JSON summary in UTF-8 encoding.",
