  "analysis": "The Python script `verify_log.py` was created and executed to perform the integrity verification of `checksum_audit.log`. The script reads the log (respecting ISO-8859-1 encoding), parses the file records, and re-calculates SHA256 hashes for the files on disk, comparing them against the hashes in the log. Based on the outcome, it appends `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED` to the log file, also in ISO-8859-1. The script also includes logic to append `END_TIME` and `END` lines if they were not present in the log before the verification status. The script has been removed after execution. All tasks (A, B, C) appear to have been addressed.",
  "plan": "The task is now considered complete. All deliverables (`checksum_audit.log` and `summary.json`) should be in place, and all specified processing steps (generation, hashing, signing, verification) have been performed according to the requirements.",
