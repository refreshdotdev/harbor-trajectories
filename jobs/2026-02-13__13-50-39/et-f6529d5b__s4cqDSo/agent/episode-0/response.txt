Then I will navigate to the source files directory and use the `find` command to locate and process all valid artifacts according to the specified filtering logic. I'll capture the start timestamp, then generate the checksum audit log file with the proper encoding and formatting. After that, I'll generate the JSON summary file. Finally, I'll perform the integrity verification and append the final status to the audit log.",
