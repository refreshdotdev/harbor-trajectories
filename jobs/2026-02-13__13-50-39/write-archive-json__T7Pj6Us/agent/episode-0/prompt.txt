You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a systems administrator responsible for a legacy file storage server. You need to write a script to perform a maintenance routine on the directory `/home/user/storage`.

This system has accumulated clutter in the `incoming/` directory, and specific retention policies must be enforced. Unlike modern systems, this server uses a mix of configuration files and strict legacy encoding requirements that you must adhere to exactly.

### 1. Configuration
The cleanup parameters are not hardcoded. You must read them from `/home/user/storage/params.conf`. This file uses a simple `key = value` format. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored. You need to extract two integer values:
- `cutoff_days`: The minimum age (in days) for a text file to be considered "old".
- `max_bak_kb`: The maximum allowed size (in Kilobytes, where 1 KB = 1024 bytes) for a backup file.

### 2. Phase One: Pruning
Scan the `/home/user/storage/incoming/` directory tree for files ending in `.bak`.
- If a `.bak` file is strictly larger than `max_bak_kb`, it should be deleted.
- **Crucial Exception:** Any filename beginning with an underscore (`_`) is a "System Hold" file. These must **NEVER** be deleted, regardless of their size or age.
- **Note:** Symbolic links must be ignored entirely during this phase.

### 3. Phase Two: Archival
Identify all `.txt` files in `/home/user/storage/incoming/` that were modified more than `cutoff_days` ago.
- Before moving any file, you must verify its content integrity. The system expects all text files to be valid UTF-8.
- **If a file contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences:** It is considered corrupt. Do **not** move it. Instead, rename the file by appending `.corrupt` to its current name (e.g., `data.txt` becomes `data.txt.corrupt`) and leave it in `incoming/`.
- **If a file is valid UTF-8:** Move it to `/home/user/storage/archive/`, preserving the original filename.

### 4. Phase Three: Manifest Generation
After the archival step is complete, you must generate a manifest of the `/home/user/storage/archive/` directory. Create a file named `manifest.csv` inside that directory.
- The CSV must list **every** file currently in `archive/` (both newly moved files and files that were already there).
- Columns: `Filename,Size,MD5`
- **Ordering:** The rows must be sorted by the **MD5 hash** of the file contents in ascending order.
- **Format:** Use standard CSV formatting (quote filenames if necessary). **CRITICAL:** The file must use Windows-style **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line endings.

### 5. Phase Four: Audit Report
Finally, produce a machine-readable summary at `/home/user/storage/summary.xml`. This file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) and match the following structure exactly:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<audit>
    <deleted_bytes>TOTAL_BYTES_OF_DELETED_BAK_FILES</deleted_bytes>
    <corrupt_files>COUNT_OF_FILES_RENAMED_TO_CORRUPT</corrupt_files>
    <manifest_sha1>SHA1_HASH_OF_THE_GENERATED_MANIFEST_CSV</manifest_sha1>
</audit>
```

- `deleted_bytes`: Integer sum of the sizes of all `.bak` files deleted in Phase One.
- `corrupt_files`: Number of text files found to be invalid UTF-8.
- `manifest_sha1`: The SHA-1 hash of the *exact* `manifest.csv` file you created in Phase Three.

### Final Cleanup
Once all operations are complete, remove any empty directories remaining under `/home/user/storage/incoming/`.

**Summary of Constraints:**
- No super-user privileges.
- Use the provided `params.conf` for thresholds.
- Respect the `_` prefix exception.
- Handle invalid UTF-8 files by renaming.
- Ensure `manifest.csv` has CRLF line endings.
- Ensure `summary.xml` is ISO-8859-1 encoded.
- Ensure `summary.xml` contains the checksum of `manifest.csv`.
