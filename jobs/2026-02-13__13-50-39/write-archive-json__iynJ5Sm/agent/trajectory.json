      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a systems administrator responsible for a legacy file storage server. You need to write a script to perform a maintenance routine on the directory `/home/user/storage`.\n\nThis system has accumulated clutter in the `incoming/` directory, and specific retention policies must be enforced. Unlike modern systems, this server uses a mix of configuration files and strict legacy encoding requirements that you must adhere to exactly.\n\n### 1. Configuration\nThe cleanup parameters are not hardcoded. You must read them from `/home/user/storage/params.conf`. This file uses a simple `key = value` format. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored. You need to extract two integer values:\n- `cutoff_days`: The minimum age (in days) for a text file to be considered \"old\".\n- `max_bak_kb`: The maximum allowed size (in Kilobytes, where 1 KB = 1024 bytes) for a backup file.\n\n### 2. Phase One: Pruning\nScan the `/home/user/storage/incoming/` directory tree for files ending in `.bak`.\n- If a `.bak` file is strictly larger than `max_bak_kb`, it should be deleted.\n- **Crucial Exception:** Any filename beginning with an underscore (`_`) is a \"System Hold\" file. These must **NEVER** be deleted, regardless of their size or age.\n- **Note:** Symbolic links must be ignored entirely during this phase.\n\n### 3. Phase Two: Archival\nIdentify all `.txt` files in `/home/user/storage/incoming/` that were modified more than `cutoff_days` ago.\n- Before moving any file, you must verify its content integrity. The system expects all text files to be valid UTF-8.\n- **If a file contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences:** It is considered corrupt. Do **not** move it. Instead, rename the file by appending `.corrupt` to its current name (e.g., `data.txt` becomes `data.txt.corrupt`) and leave it in `incoming/`.\n- **If a file is valid UTF-8:** Move it to `/home/user/storage/archive/`, preserving the original filename.\n\n### 4. Phase Three: Manifest Generation\nAfter the archival step is complete, you must generate a manifest of the `/home/user/storage/archive/` directory. Create a file named `manifest.csv` inside that directory.\n- The CSV must list **every** file currently in `archive/` (both newly moved files and files that were already there).\n- Columns: `Filename,Size,MD5`\n- **Ordering:** The rows must be sorted by the **MD5 hash** of the file contents in ascending order.\n- **Format:** Use standard CSV formatting (quote filenames if necessary). **CRITICAL:** The file must use Windows-style **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.\n\n### 5. Phase Four: Audit Report\nFinally, produce a machine-readable summary at `/home/user/storage/summary.xml`. This file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) and match the following structure exactly:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<audit>\n    <deleted_bytes>TOTAL_BYTES_OF_DELETED_BAK_FILES</deleted_bytes>\n    <corrupt_files>COUNT_OF_FILES_RENAMED_TO_CORRUPT</corrupt_files>\n    <manifest_sha1>SHA1_HASH_OF_THE_GENERATED_MANIFEST_CSV</manifest_sha1>\n</audit>\n```\n\n- `deleted_bytes`: Integer sum of the sizes of all `.bak` files deleted in Phase One.\n- `corrupt_files`: Number of text files found to be invalid UTF-8.\n- `manifest_sha1`: The SHA-1 hash of the *exact* `manifest.csv` file you created in Phase Three.\n\n### Final Cleanup\nOnce all operations are complete, remove any empty directories remaining under `/home/user/storage/incoming/`.\n\n**Summary of Constraints:**\n- No super-user privileges.\n- Use the provided `params.conf` for thresholds.\n- Respect the `_` prefix exception.\n- Handle invalid UTF-8 files by renaming.\n- Ensure `manifest.csv` has CRLF line endings.\n- Ensure `summary.xml` is ISO-8859-1 encoded.\n- Ensure `summary.xml` contains the checksum of `manifest.csv`.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@d323ce65-3413-48f9-acdf-628c9fe1faa0:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
