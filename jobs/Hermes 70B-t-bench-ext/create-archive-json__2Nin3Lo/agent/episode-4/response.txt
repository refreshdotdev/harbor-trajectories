  "analysis": "The Python script `manage_experiments.py` was created but failed to execute due to a syntax error: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` on line 182, specifically `relative_path = file_path.relative_to(EXPERIMENTS_ROOT).`. The period at the end of the line is the cause of this syntax error. The `ls -la /home/user/experiments/` command shows that the directory structure was created, including the `ckpt_archive` directory and several `run_YYYY-MM-DD` directories, but the main processing by the Python script did not occur. The script file itself is present and executable.",
  "plan": "I will correct the syntax error in `manage_experiments.py` on line 182 by removing the extraneous period. I will then attempt to execute the corrected script. If the script runs successfully, it should process the experiment runs, move valid checkpoints, generate the inventory CSV, and create the summary log. After the script execution, I will list the contents of `/home/user/experiments/` again to verify the presence and correctness of the output files.",
