  "analysis": "I have listed the configuration files. The files matching the pattern `config_YYYYMMDD.conf` are:\n- `config_20230115.conf`\n- `config_20230410.conf`\n- `config_20230718.conf`\n- `config_20230901.conf`\nThe file `config_backup.conf` does not match the naming convention and will be ignored. The reference date is `20230801`. According to the time travel rule, any file with a date strictly later than `20230801` must be ignored. This means `config_20230901.conf` (date `20230901`) will be ignored. The valid files to process are `config_20230115.conf`, `config_20230410.conf`, and `config_20230718.conf`.",
  "plan": "The next steps involve processing these three valid configuration files. I will need to:\n1.  Count active lines for `output/config_line_counts.tsv`.\n2.  Extract all keys for `output/all_keys.txt`.\n3.  Create sanitised copies in `clean_configs/`.\n4.  Identify new keys in the newest vs. oldest valid file for `output/new_keys.log`.\n5.  Create a merged configuration `output/merged_config.csv`.\n\nI'll start by creating a list of the valid files and then process them individually. For now, I'll store the list of valid files and their properties (filename, date).",
