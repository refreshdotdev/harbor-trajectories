  "analysis": "The AWK script `process_config.awk` has been created. It's designed to parse configuration files line by line, skipping comments and blank lines. For active `key = value` lines, it normalizes the key (lowercase, stripped of spaces) and parses the value, correctly handling quoted and unquoted values as per the rules. It will output the processed `key=value` pair (for sanitised files), count active lines per file, and collect all unique keys. The next step is to execute this AWK script for each valid configuration file.",
  "plan": "1. I need to initialize temporary files for collecting aggregated data: `config_line_counts.tmp` and `all_keys.tmp`. 2. Iterate through each valid file listed in `valid_files.txt`. For each file: a. Run `process_config.awk` on it. The script will write processed lines (for sanitised files) to standard output, which I'll redirect to the corresponding file in `clean_configs/`. b. The `END` block of the AWK script will append line counts to `config_line_counts.tmp` and unique keys to `all_keys.tmp`.",
