Consequently, the output files will reflect this: line counts will be zero, no keys will be found, sanitised files will be empty, new keys list will be empty, and the merged configuration will be empty.",
  "plan": "Given the empty input files, I will proceed to generate the required output artefacts. Their content will be minimal or empty as per the rules. I'll:\n1.  Ensure `config_line_counts.tsv` is correctly formatted, including the header and zero counts for each valid file. (The AWK script's `END` block should handle this if the files are processed, even if empty).\n2.  Ensure `all_keys.txt` is empty or contains only header if any was added.\n3.  Ensure `clean_configs/` directory contains empty files corresponding to the valid input files.\n4.  Create `new_keys.log` as empty.\n5.  Create `merged_config.csv` as empty (or with header only).\n\nI need to re-run the processing loop, perhaps with a more specific check for the error message or by ensuring the AWK script's output redirection doesn't cause a false sense of failure if the output file is empty. The `.new` files created by the manual `awk` command should be moved to their final names.",
