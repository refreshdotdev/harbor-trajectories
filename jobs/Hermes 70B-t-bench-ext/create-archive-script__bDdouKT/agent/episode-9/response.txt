  "analysis": "The processing loop has run. As expected, since the input configuration files are empty, the sanitised files in `clean_configs/` are also empty. The temporary files `output/config_line_counts.tmp` and `output/all_keys.tmp` are also empty because the AWK script's `END` block did not find any data to populate the `line_count` or `all_keys` arrays. The intermediate `.processed` files from the first attempt are also present and empty. I need to clean these up and finalize the output files.",
  "plan": "1. Clean up the intermediate `.processed` files from `clean_configs/`. 2. Finalize `output/config_line_counts.tsv`: Add rows for each valid file with a count of 0. The AWK script was supposed to do this, but since input files were empty, its `END` block produced no output to the `.tmp` file. I'll need to construct this content manually. 3. Finalize `output/all_keys.txt`: Since no keys were found, this file should be empty (or contain a header if one was intended, but the problem doesn't specify a header). The AWK script also produced no output to `all_keys.tmp`. 4. Create `output/new_keys.log`: This will be empty. 5. Create `output/merged_config.csv`: This will be empty (or with header only).",
