I'll proceed by first verifying what files exist and then creating the apply_hardening.sh script.",

Then I'll check if apply_hardening.sh already exists and back it up if needed. After that, I'll create the main script file and populate it with the automation logic as specified in the requirements. The script will be made executable after creation.",
