Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a Linux systems engineer who has been asked to create a generic \u201clab-hardening\u201d automation in your own home directory.\nThree configuration files and a **rules file** have already been placed in `/home/user/hardening_test/` for you to practise on.\nYour goal is to write one self-contained POSIX-sh compatible script named\n\n    /home/user/hardening_test/apply_hardening.sh\n\nthat performs all of the actions listed below.\n\n### Automation requirements\n\n1.  **Rule-based Processing**\n    *   The script must read the hardening rules from `/home/user/hardening_test/rules.txt`.\n    *   Each line in this file follows the format: `filename|search_pattern|enforced_line`\n        *   `filename`: The target file in the current directory.\n        *   `search_pattern`: A grep-compatible Extended Regex (ERE) used to find existing configuration keys.\n        *   `enforced_line`: The exact string that must be present in the file.\n\n2.  **Safety Backup**\n    *   Before processing a file, check if a backup named `<filename>.bak` exists.\n    *   If `<filename>.bak` does **not** exist, create it as a copy of the current file.\n    *   If `<filename>.bak` **already** exists, preserve it (do not overwrite it). This ensures we always keep the pristine original state.\n\n3.  **Tri-state Logic**\n    *   For each file defined in `rules.txt`, apply the following logic in order:\n        1.  **SKIPPED**: If the file already contains the `enforced_line` exactly (byte-for-byte line match), do nothing to the content.\n        2.  **REPAIRED**: If the file does *not* contain the exact line, but *does* contain a line matching the `search_pattern`, replace that matching line with the `enforced_line` in-place.\n        3.  **APPENDED**: If the `search_pattern` is not found at all, append the `enforced_line` to the end of the file.\n\n4.  **Strict Permissions**\n    *   After processing (regardless of whether the file was changed), enforce the following permissions:\n        *   `sshd_config`: Read/Write for owner only (0600).\n        *   All other files: Read/Write for owner, Read for group/others (0644).\n\n5.  **Structured & Sorted Logging**\n    *   The script must create/overwrite a log file:\n        `/home/user/hardening_test/hardening.log`\n    *   Format per line: `<FILENAME>:<ACTION>`\n        *   `<ACTION>` is one of: `SKIPPED`, `REPAIRED`, `APPENDED`.\n    *   **Constraint**: The final lines in `hardening.log` must be **sorted alphabetically** by filename.\n\n    Example of a sorted log:\n    ```\n    login.defs:SKIPPED\n    sshd_config:REPAIRED\n    sysctl.conf:APPENDED\n    ```\n\n6.  **User feedback**\n    *   When the script finishes, it must print the single line\n\n            Hardening completed\n\n        to STDOUT (nothing else).\n\n### Additional constraints\n\n*   The script must be executable (chmod +x).\n*   Use only shell built-ins and common GNU/Linux user-land tools (grep, sed, sort, chmod, etc.).\n*   Do not edit files outside `/home/user/hardening_test/`.\n*   Ensure that the final state exactly meets the specifications so that an automated grader can validate:\n    *   presence of `*.bak` backups (byte-for-byte copy of the originals),\n    *   target files contain the enforced lines (no duplicates created if already present),\n    *   correct permissions on target files,\n    *   a correctly formatted and sorted `hardening.log`.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@74a8d03f-6e18-4e29-8314-82f247838732:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a Linux systems engineer who has been asked to create a generic \u201clab-hardening\u201d automation in your own home directory.\nThree configuration files and a **rules file** have already been placed in `/home/user/hardening_test/` for you to practise on.\nYour goal is to write one self-contained POSIX-sh compatible script named\n\n    /home/user/hardening_test/apply_hardening.sh\n\nthat performs all of the actions listed below.\n\n### Automation requirements\n\n1.  **Rule-based Processing**\n    *   The script must read the hardening rules from `/home/user/hardening_test/rules.txt`.\n    *   Each line in this file follows the format: `filename|search_pattern|enforced_line`\n        *   `filename`: The target file in the current directory.\n        *   `search_pattern`: A grep-compatible Extended Regex (ERE) used to find existing configuration keys.\n        *   `enforced_line`: The exact string that must be present in the file.\n\n2.  **Safety Backup**\n    *   Before processing a file, check if a backup named `<filename>.bak` exists.\n    *   If `<filename>.bak` does **not** exist, create it as a copy of the current file.\n    *   If `<filename>.bak` **already** exists, preserve it (do not overwrite it). This ensures we always keep the pristine original state.\n\n3.  **Tri-state Logic**\n    *   For each file defined in `rules.txt`, apply the following logic in order:\n        1.  **SKIPPED**: If the file already contains the `enforced_line` exactly (byte-for-byte line match), do nothing to the content.\n        2.  **REPAIRED**: If the file does *not* contain the exact line, but *does* contain a line matching the `search_pattern`, replace that matching line with the `enforced_line` in-place.\n        3.  **APPENDED**: If the `search_pattern` is not found at all, append the `enforced_line` to the end of the file.\n\n4.  **Strict Permissions**\n    *   After processing (regardless of whether the file was changed), enforce the following permissions:\n        *   `sshd_config`: Read/Write for owner only (0600).\n        *   All other files: Read/Write for owner, Read for group/others (0644).\n\n5.  **Structured & Sorted Logging**\n    *   The script must create/overwrite a log file:\n        `/home/user/hardening_test/hardening.log`\n    *   Format per line: `<FILENAME>:<ACTION>`\n        *   `<ACTION>` is one of: `SKIPPED`, `REPAIRED`, `APPENDED`.\n    *   **Constraint**: The final lines in `hardening.log` must be **sorted alphabetically** by filename.\n\n    Example of a sorted log:\n    ```\n    login.defs:SKIPPED\n    sshd_config:REPAIRED\n    sysctl.conf:APPENDED\n    ```\n\n6.  **User feedback**\n    *   When the script finishes, it must print the single line\n\n            Hardening completed\n\n        to STDOUT (nothing else).\n\n### Additional constraints\n\n*   The script must be executable (chmod +x).\n*   Use only shell built-ins and common GNU/Linux user-land tools (grep, sed, sort, chmod, etc.).\n*   Do not edit files outside `/home/user/hardening_test/`.\n*   Ensure that the final state exactly meets the specifications so that an automated grader can validate:\n    *   presence of `*.bak` backups (byte-for-byte copy of the originals),\n    *   target files contain the enforced lines (no duplicates created if already present),\n    *   correct permissions on target files,\n    *   a correctly formatted and sorted `hardening.log`.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@74a8d03f-6e18-4e29-8314-82f247838732:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The core work will involve processing rules from rules.txt and implementing the specified backup, modification, permission, and logging logic.\",\n  \"plan\": \"First, I'll navigate to the target directory /home/user/hardening_test.

The script will need to implement: rule-based processing from rules.txt, safety backups before file modifications, tri-state logic (SKIPPED/REPAIRED/APPENDED) for configuration changes, strict file permissions enforcement, and structured sorted logging to hardening.log.
