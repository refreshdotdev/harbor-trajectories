This ensures we always keep the pristine original state.\n\n3.  **Tri-state Logic**\n    *   For each file defined in `rules.txt`, apply the following logic in order:\n        1.  **SKIPPED**: If the file already contains the `enforced_line` exactly (byte-for-byte line match), do nothing to the content.\n        2.  **REPAIRED**: If the file does *not* contain the exact line, but *does* contain a line matching the `search_pattern`, replace that matching line with the `enforced_line` in-place.\n        3.  **APPENDED**: If the `search_pattern` is not found at all, append the `enforced_line` to the end of the file.\n\n4.  **Strict Permissions**\n    *   After processing (regardless of whether the file was changed), enforce the following permissions:\n        *   `sshd_config`: Read/Write for owner only (0600).\n        *   All other files: Read/Write for owner, Read for group/others (0644).\n\n5.  **Structured & Sorted Logging**\n    *   The script must create/overwrite a log file:\n        `/home/user/hardening_test/hardening.log`\n    *   Format per line: `<FILENAME>:<ACTION>`\n        *   `<ACTION>` is one of: `SKIPPED`, `REPAIRED`, `APPENDED`.\n    *   **Constraint**: The final lines in `hardening.log` must be **sorted alphabetically** by filename.\n\n    Example of a sorted log:\n    ```\n    login.defs:SKIPPED\n    sshd_config:REPAIRED\n    sysctl.conf:APPENDED\n    ```\n\n6.  **User feedback**\n    *   When the script finishes, it must print the single line\n\n            Hardening completed\n\n        to STDOUT (nothing else).\n\n### Additional constraints\n\n*   The script must be executable (chmod +x).\n*   Use only shell built-ins and common GNU/Linux user-land tools (grep, sed, sort, chmod, etc.).\n*   Do not edit files outside `/home/user/hardening_test/`.\n*   Ensure that the final state exactly meets the specifications so that an automated grader can validate:\n    *   presence of `*.bak` backups (byte-for-byte copy of the originals),\n    *   target files contain the enforced lines (no duplicates created if already present),\n    *   correct permissions on target files,\n    *   a correctly formatted and sorted `hardening.log`.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@536657ee-7e4d-45b2-b3c7-1cb971fb2752:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
