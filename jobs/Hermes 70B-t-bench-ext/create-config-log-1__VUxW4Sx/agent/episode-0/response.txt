I need to set this variable, create the necessary directory structure (baseline/, current/, backups/, patches/, logs/), and place the required configuration files with specific content and line endings to meet the task requirements.",
  "plan": "First, I'll set the NET_CONF_DIR environment variable to its default value of '/home/user/network_ops'. Then, I'll navigate to this directory and create the required subdirectories: baseline/, current/, backups/, patches/, and logs/. After creating the directories, I'll create the baseline/router.conf file with the known-good configuration and Unix line endings. Next, I'll create the current/router.conf file with the broken configuration, ensuring it has DOS line endings. This setup will allow me to proceed with the backup, normalization, patching, metrics, and verification steps as per the task description.",
