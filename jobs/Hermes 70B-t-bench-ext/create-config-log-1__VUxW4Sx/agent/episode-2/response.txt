  "analysis": "The environment is now set up correctly. NET_CONF_DIR is set to '/home/user/network_ops', and I am in this directory. The subdirectories (baseline/, current/, backups/, patches/, logs/) have been created. The baseline/router.conf file has been created with the known-good configuration and Unix line endings. The current/router.conf file has been created with the broken configuration and DOS line endings, as required.

  "plan": "I will now perform the sequence of operations as per the task description:\n1.  **Backup**: Create a gzip-compressed backup of the original current/router.conf (with DOS line endings) at backups/router.conf.orig.gz.\n2.  **Normalize**: Convert current/router.conf to use Unix line endings (LF) in-place.\n3.  **Log**: Record the 'NORMALIZED_LF' action in the patch_application.log file.\n4.  **Patch Creation**: Produce a unified-diff patch that converts the normalized current/router.conf into baseline/router.conf, saving it to patches/router_fix.patch. I'll verify the patch content.\n5.  **Log**: Record the 'CREATED_PATCH' action.\n6.  **Metrics**: Create a JSON file logs/metrics.json containing the size of the original file and the patch file.\n7.  **Log**: Record the 'METRICS_LOGGED' action (as per my interpretation of the log requirements).\n8.  **Apply**: Apply the patch to current/router.conf.\n9.  **Log**: Record the 'APPLIED_PATCH' action.\n10. **Verify**: Ensure the current/router.conf file is now byte-for-byte identical to baseline/router.conf.\n11. **Log**: Record the 'VERIFIED_CONFIG' action.",
