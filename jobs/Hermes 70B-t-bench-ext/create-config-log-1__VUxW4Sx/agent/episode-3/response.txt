  "analysis": "The previous execution failed. The patch application reported 'Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!', and the final verification showed that 'current/router.conf' and 'baseline/router.conf' differ. This indicates the patch was not applied correctly or the files were in an unexpected state. The task cannot be considered complete due to these failures. I will start over to ensure all steps are executed correctly from the beginning, as the current state of files is inconsistent with the requirements.",
  "plan": "I will reset the environment by re-creating the directory structure and files from scratch. Then, I will re-execute all operations: backup the original DOS-formatted current/router.conf, normalize its line endings, create the patch from the normalized current file to the baseline, log metrics, apply the patch, and verify the result. I will also correct the log file creation to ensure it only contains the five specified action lines in the correct order.",
