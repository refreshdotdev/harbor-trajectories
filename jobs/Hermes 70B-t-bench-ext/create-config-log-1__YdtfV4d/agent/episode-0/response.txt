The task specifies using the `NET_CONF_DIR` environment variable, defaulting to `/home/user/network_ops` if not set. I will first check if this variable exists and then explore the directory structure to ensure the necessary subdirectories (`baseline/`, `current/`) and files (`router.conf`) are present as expected.",

Explore the directory structure to locate the `baseline/` and `current/` subdirectories and their respective `router.conf` files. 4. Begin the backup process by creating the `backups/` directory if it doesn't exist.",
