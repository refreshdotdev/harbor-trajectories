  "analysis": "The configuration root directory has been successfully set to `/home/user/network_ops`. The required subdirectories (`baseline/`, `current/`, `backups/`, `logs/`, `patches/`) are present. However, both `baseline/router.conf` and `current/router.conf` are empty (0 bytes). The task requires specific content (DOS line endings for `current/router.conf`, specific configuration lines for `baseline/router.conf`, and the patch must contain specific hunks). Since these files are empty, I need to create them with the necessary content before proceeding with backup, normalization, patching, etc.",
  "plan": "1. Create the `current/router.conf` file with the specified content, ensuring it has DOS line endings (CRLF). 2. Create the `baseline/router.conf` file with the known-good configuration and Unix line endings (LF). 3. Verify the contents and line endings of both files. 4. Proceed with the backup of the original `current/router.conf`.",
