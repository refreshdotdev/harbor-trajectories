  "analysis": "The `sed` command executed to normalize line endings in `current/router.conf` appeared to complete, but the `cat -A` output shows that DOS line endings (CRLF, indicated by `$`) are still present. The `sed -i` command might not be working as expected, or the shell's `$'...'` quoting mechanism is interfering with the backslash-escaped carriage return `\\r`. I need to ensure the normalization is successful. I will try an alternative approach using `tr -d '\\r'` to remove carriage returns, which should achieve the same result (converting CRLF to LF).",
  "plan": "1. Re-attempt normalization of `current/router.conf` using `tr -d '\\r'`. 2. Verify the line endings of `current/router.conf` again to confirm CRLF has been removed. 3. If successful, log the `NORMALIZED_LF` action (the timestamp will be new).",
