      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a network engineer called in to troubleshoot a connectivity problem on a router. A configuration directory structure exists, but the environment is dynamic, and the files have formatting inconsistencies.\n\n### Environment\n\n*   The configuration root directory is defined by the environment variable `NET_CONF_DIR`. You **must** use this variable. If it is not set, default to `/home/user/network_ops`.\n*   Inside this directory, there are two subdirectories:\n    *   `baseline/` (contains the known-good `router.conf`)\n    *   `current/` (contains the broken `router.conf`)\n\n### Complications\n\n1.  **Line Endings**: The `current/router.conf` file was uploaded from a Windows machine and contains DOS line endings (CRLF). The `baseline/router.conf` uses Unix line endings (LF). Your final fixed file must use Unix line endings.\n2.  **Backup**: Before modifying anything, you must create a compressed backup of the original broken file.\n3.  **Metrics**: You must calculate and log specific file size metrics.\n\n### Objective\n\nPerform the following sequence of operations. If any step fails, you should log a failure (though the grader expects success).\n\n1.  **Backup**: Create a gzip-compressed backup of the *original* `current/router.conf` (including its DOS line endings) at `backups/router.conf.orig.gz` (inside the configuration root).\n2.  **Normalize**: Convert `current/router.conf` to use Unix line endings (LF) in-place.\n3.  **Patch Creation**: Produce a unified-diff patch that converts the now-normalized `current/router.conf` into `baseline/router.conf`. Save it to `patches/router_fix.patch`.\n4.  **Metrics**: Create a JSON file `logs/metrics.json` containing the size of the *original* (pre-normalization) file and the size of the generated patch file.\n5.  **Apply**: Apply the patch to `current/router.conf`.\n6.  **Verify**: Ensure the file is now byte-for-byte identical to baseline.\n\n### File & Directory Rules\n\n*   **Root Directory**: Use `$NET_CONF_DIR`.\n*   **Patch Format**: Standard GNU unified-diff.\n    *   Header:\n        ```\n        --- current/router.conf\n        +++ baseline/router.conf\n        ```\n    *   Required Hunks (LF format) - ensure these changes are present:\n        ```\n        - ip address 10.0.0.2/24\n        + ip address 10.0.0.1/24\n        - shutdown\n        + no shutdown\n        + network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0\n        ```\n*   **Metrics File**: `logs/metrics.json` must be valid JSON:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"original_size_bytes\": 1234,\n      \"patch_size_bytes\": 567\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   **Log File**: `logs/patch_application.log` must contain exactly **five** lines in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ - ACTION - RESULT`. The actions must appear in this order:\n    1.  `BACKED_UP`\n    2.  `NORMALIZED_LF`\n    3.  `CREATED_PATCH`\n    4.  `APPLIED_PATCH`\n    5.  `VERIFIED_CONFIG`\n\n    All results should be `OK`.\n\n### Final Check\n\nThe grader will verify:\n1.  `backups/router.conf.orig.gz` exists and is a valid gzip file.\n2.  `current/router.conf` is byte-identical to `baseline/router.conf` (LF endings).\n3.  `logs/metrics.json` exists and contains valid integers.\n4.  `logs/patch_application.log` has 5 correct lines.\n5.  The patch file exists and is valid.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@04ec5b6d-f086-4b1a-ab01-f776f17712db:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
