Normalize line endings in `current/router.conf` to LF.\n3. Create a unified-diff patch from the normalized `current/router.conf` to `baseline/router.conf`.\n4. Log the creation of the patch.\n5. Calculate and log file size metrics (original file and patch size) into `logs/metrics.json`.\n6. Log the metrics calculation.\n7. Apply the patch to `current/router.conf`.\n8. Log the patch application.\n9. Verify that `current/router.conf` is now byte-for-byte identical to `baseline/router.conf`.\n10. Log the verification result.",
