Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Post-Experiment Aggregation Task\n\nYou are an MLOps engineer tasked with aggregating results from a distributed hyperparameter optimization campaign. The experiment runner has generated a directory tree containing log files from various solver runs. Your objective is to parse these logs, filter out unstable or excluded runs based on a configuration file, and generate a summary report with a checksum manifest.\n\n## Environment Context\n\nThe experiments are stored in `/home/user/experiments/`. This directory contains:\n1.  **Run Directories**: Subdirectories (e.g., `run_alpha`, `run_beta`, `test_run_01`) containing execution logs.\n2.  **Global Configuration**: A file named `experiment_config.txt` located at the root (`/home/user/experiments/experiment_config.txt`).\n\n## Input Data Specifications\n\n### 1. The Configuration File\nThe `experiment_config.txt` is a key-value store (format: `key=value`) that governs the aggregation logic. It defines:\n-   `exclude_regex`: A regular expression. Any **directory name** matching this pattern must be ignored entirely, regardless of its contents.\n-   `precision`: An integer specifying the number of decimal places for the calculated average.\n\n### 2. Log Files\nInside each non-excluded directory, look for a file named `solver_run.log`. \n-   **Format**: CSV with header `iteration,objective,elapsed_sec`.\n-   **Encoding**: Most files are UTF-8, but some legacy nodes generate **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** logs. These may contain special characters (e.g., in units or comments). Your solution must handle both encodings seamlessly.\n-   **Content**: \n    -   `iteration`: Integer or string (e.g., \"final\").\n    -   `objective`: Float value.\n    -   `elapsed_sec`: Float value.\n\n## Processing Logic\n\n1.  **Discovery**: Traverse the `/home/user/experiments/` directory to find all `solver_run.log` files in directories that do **not** match the `exclude_regex` from the config.\n2.  **Validation & Filtering**:\n    -   For each log file, parse the `objective` column.\n    -   **Instability Rule**: If a log file contains *any* `NaN`, `Inf`, or `-Inf` values in the `objective` column, the experiment is considered \"unstable\". You must **discard the entire file** from the calculation.\n    -   **Minimization**: For valid files, identify the minimum `objective` value achieved during the run.\n3.  **Aggregation**:\n    -   Calculate the **arithmetic mean** of the minimum objectives from all valid, stable runs.\n    -   Round this average to the number of decimal places specified in the `precision` config setting.\n    -   Identify the **latest activity timestamp**: This is the modification time (mtime) of the *most recently modified valid log file* that contributed to the average.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/experiments/`.\n\n### Output 1: `summary.json`\nA JSON object with the following keys:\n-   `valid_runs`: Integer count of files included in the average.\n-   `average_min_objective`: The rounded average (number).\n-   `latest_activity`: The latest activity timestamp formatted as an ISO 8601 string (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00`).\n\n**Critical Constraint**: The JSON file must be encoded in **pure ASCII**. If the timestamp or any other field would generate non-ASCII characters, they must be escaped.\n\n### Output 2: `manifest.txt`\nA checksum file used for verification. It must contain exactly one string in the format:\n`summary.json:<MD5_CHECKSUM_OF_SUMMARY_FILE>`\n\n**Strict Format Requirement**: This file must contain **no trailing newline** characters. It should end immediately after the last character of the checksum.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n-   Do not install new packages (use standard Python libraries).\n-   Respect `experiment_config.txt` for exclusion and precision.\n-   Handle mixed encodings (UTF-8 and Latin-1).\n-   Discard entire files if they contain infinite/NaN values.\n-   Ensure `manifest.txt` has no trailing newline.\n-   Do not modify the original logs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b0567c87-de1e-47ba-bcd9-4add759f43c7:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Post-Experiment Aggregation Task\n\nYou are an MLOps engineer tasked with aggregating results from a distributed hyperparameter optimization campaign. The experiment runner has generated a directory tree containing log files from various solver runs. Your objective is to parse these logs, filter out unstable or excluded runs based on a configuration file, and generate a summary report with a checksum manifest.\n\n## Environment Context\n\nThe experiments are stored in `/home/user/experiments/`. This directory contains:\n1.  **Run Directories**: Subdirectories (e.g., `run_alpha`, `run_beta`, `test_run_01`) containing execution logs.\n2.  **Global Configuration**: A file named `experiment_config.txt` located at the root (`/home/user/experiments/experiment_config.txt`).\n\n## Input Data Specifications\n\n### 1. The Configuration File\nThe `experiment_config.txt` is a key-value store (format: `key=value`) that governs the aggregation logic. It defines:\n-   `exclude_regex`: A regular expression. Any **directory name** matching this pattern must be ignored entirely, regardless of its contents.\n-   `precision`: An integer specifying the number of decimal places for the calculated average.\n\n### 2. Log Files\nInside each non-excluded directory, look for a file named `solver_run.log`. \n-   **Format**: CSV with header `iteration,objective,elapsed_sec`.\n-   **Encoding**: Most files are UTF-8, but some legacy nodes generate **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** logs. These may contain special characters (e.g., in units or comments). Your solution must handle both encodings seamlessly.\n-   **Content**: \n    -   `iteration`: Integer or string (e.g., \"final\").\n    -   `objective`: Float value.\n    -   `elapsed_sec`: Float value.\n\n## Processing Logic\n\n1.  **Discovery**: Traverse the `/home/user/experiments/` directory to find all `solver_run.log` files in directories that do **not** match the `exclude_regex` from the config.\n2.  **Validation & Filtering**:\n    -   For each log file, parse the `objective` column.\n    -   **Instability Rule**: If a log file contains *any* `NaN`, `Inf`, or `-Inf` values in the `objective` column, the experiment is considered \"unstable\". You must **discard the entire file** from the calculation.\n    -   **Minimization**: For valid files, identify the minimum `objective` value achieved during the run.\n3.  **Aggregation**:\n    -   Calculate the **arithmetic mean** of the minimum objectives from all valid, stable runs.\n    -   Round this average to the number of decimal places specified in the `precision` config setting.\n    -   Identify the **latest activity timestamp**: This is the modification time (mtime) of the *most recently modified valid log file* that contributed to the average.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/experiments/`.\n\n### Output 1: `summary.json`\nA JSON object with the following keys:\n-   `valid_runs`: Integer count of files included in the average.\n-   `average_min_objective`: The rounded average (number).\n-   `latest_activity`: The latest activity timestamp formatted as an ISO 8601 string (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00`).\n\n**Critical Constraint**: The JSON file must be encoded in **pure ASCII**. If the timestamp or any other field would generate non-ASCII characters, they must be escaped.\n\n### Output 2: `manifest.txt`\nA checksum file used for verification. It must contain exactly one string in the format:\n`summary.json:<MD5_CHECKSUM_OF_SUMMARY_FILE>`\n\n**Strict Format Requirement**: This file must contain **no trailing newline** characters. It should end immediately after the last character of the checksum.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n-   Do not install new packages (use standard Python libraries).\n-   Respect `experiment_config.txt` for exclusion and precision.\n-   Handle mixed encodings (UTF-8 and Latin-1).\n-   Discard entire files if they contain infinite/NaN values.\n-   Ensure `manifest.txt` has no trailing newline.\n-   Do not modify the original logs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b0567c87-de1e-47ba-bcd9-4add759f43c7:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The experiment runner has generated a directory tree containing log files from various solver runs. Your objective is to parse these logs, filter out unstable or excluded runs based on a configuration file, and generate a summary report with a checksum manifest.\n\n## Environment Context\n\nThe experiments are stored in `/home/user/experiments/`. This directory contains:\n1.  **Run Directories**: Subdirectories (e.g., `run_alpha`, `run_beta`, `test_run_01`) containing execution logs.\n2.  **Global Configuration**: A file named `experiment_config.txt` located at the root (`/home/user/experiments/experiment_config.txt`).\n\n## Input Data Specifications\n\n### 1. The Configuration File\nThe `experiment_config.txt` is a key-value store (format: `key=value`) that governs the aggregation logic. It defines:\n-   `exclude_regex`: A regular expression. Any **directory name** matching this pattern must be ignored entirely, regardless of its contents.\n-   `precision`: An integer specifying the number of decimal places for the calculated average.\n\n### 2. Log Files\nInside each non-excluded directory, look for a file named `solver_run.log`. \n-   **Format**: CSV with header `iteration,objective,elapsed_sec`.\n-   **Encoding**: Most files are UTF-8, but some legacy nodes generate **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** logs. These may contain special characters (e.g., in units or comments). Your solution must handle both encodings seamlessly.\n-   **Content**: \n    -   `iteration`: Integer or string (e.g., \"final\").\n    -   `objective`: Float value.\n    -   `elapsed_sec`: Float value.\n\n## Processing Logic\n\n1.  **Discovery**: Traverse the `/home/user/experiments/` directory to find all `solver_run.log` files in directories that do **not** match the `exclude_regex` from the config.\n2.  **Validation & Filtering**:\n    -   For each log file, parse the `objective` column.\n    -   **Instability Rule**: If a log file contains *any* `NaN`, `Inf`, or `-Inf` values in the `objective` column, the experiment is considered \"unstable\". You must **discard the entire file** from the calculation.\n    -   **Minimization**: For valid files, identify the minimum `objective` value achieved during the run.\n3.  **Aggregation**:\n    -   Calculate the **arithmetic mean** of the minimum objectives from all valid, stable runs.\n    -   Round this average to the number of decimal places specified in the `precision` config setting.\n    -   Identify the **latest activity timestamp**: This is the modification time (mtime) of the *most recently modified valid log file* that contributed to the average.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/experiments/`.\n\n### Output 1: `summary.json`\nA JSON object with the following keys:\n-   `valid_runs`: Integer count of files included in the average.\n-   `average_min_objective`: The rounded average (number).\n-   `latest_activity`: The latest activity timestamp formatted as an ISO 8601 string (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00`).\n\n**Critical Constraint**: The JSON file must be encoded in **pure ASCII**. If the timestamp or any other field would generate non-ASCII characters, they must be escaped.\n\n### Output 2: `manifest.txt`\nA checksum file used for verification. It must contain exactly one string in the format:\n`summary.json:<MD5_CHECKSUM_OF_SUMMARY_FILE>`\n\n**Strict Format Requirement**: This file must contain **no trailing newline** characters. It should end immediately after the last character of the checksum.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n-   Do not install new packages (use standard Python libraries).\n-   Respect `experiment_config.txt` for exclusion and precision.\n-   Handle mixed encodings (UTF-8 and Latin-1).\n-   Discard entire files if they contain infinite/NaN values.\n-   Ensure `manifest.txt` has no trailing newline.\n-   Do not modify the original logs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b0567c87-de1e-47ba-bcd9-4add759f43c7:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
