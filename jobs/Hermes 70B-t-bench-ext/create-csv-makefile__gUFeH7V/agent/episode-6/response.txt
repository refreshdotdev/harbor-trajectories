The issue must be in how these commands are integrated into the Makefile recipe. I'll examine the Makefile's clean target more closely and try running just the awk portion with proper debugging.",

I'll try running the entire pipeline with verbose output to see exactly where it might be failing. I'll also create the cleaned directory manually to ensure it exists.",
