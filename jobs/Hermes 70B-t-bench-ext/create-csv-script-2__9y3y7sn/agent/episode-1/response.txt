  "analysis": "I have successfully navigated to `/home/user/inventory`. The directory contains the expected input files: `ssh_audit.csv` (285 bytes, last modified Oct 25 2023) and `legacy_map.conf` (0 bytes, last modified Feb 13). The `file` command is not available in this environment. I've examined the content of `ssh_audit.csv` using `head -5`, which reveals the CSV structure: `serverName,port,permitRootLogin,protocol,owner,extra`. It also shows a header, some data lines, and an example of a comment line with leading whitespace (`  # This is a indented comment`). The `legacy_map.conf` file appears to be empty based on its size and `head` output. The next step is to get the Last Modification Time (mtime) of `ssh_audit.csv` in ISO-8601 UTC format, which is crucial for the verification log.",
  "plan": "To get the mtime of `ssh_audit.csv` in ISO-8601 UTC format, I will use the `stat` command. The exact format string for `stat` depends on the system; common Linux systems support `--format=%y`. If this fails, I'll try alternative formats like `--format=%Y` or parse from `ls --full-time`. Once I have the timestamp, I can begin processing the CSV data according to the requirements.",
