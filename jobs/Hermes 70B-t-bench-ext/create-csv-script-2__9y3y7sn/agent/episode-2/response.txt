  "analysis": "I have successfully obtained the Last Modification Time (mtime) of `ssh_audit.csv`. Using `stat --format=%y ssh_audit.csv`, I got `2023-10-25 12:00:00.000000000 +0000`. This is the timestamp I need for the verification log. The file is in ISO-8859-1 encoding as specified. The `legacy_map.conf` file is empty, which means no hostname renames will be applied. I am now ready to process the `ssh_audit.csv` data.",
  "plan": "I will now begin the data processing. The first step is to extract all relevant data from `ssh_audit.csv` and perform initial transformations. This involves: 1. Filtering out comment lines (both `#...` and `  #...`). 2. Processing the `permitRootLogin` column. 3. Filtering records based on the `protocol` column (only `2`, unless a rename rule existed, which it doesn't). 4. Converting the entire stream from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. I will use `grep`, `sed`, and `iconv` for these operations. The output will be stored in a temporary staging file.",
