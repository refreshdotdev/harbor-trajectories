Subsequent lines contain data with various values in the `protocol` and `permitRootLogin` columns. I can see special characters like `é` and `ü` which appear to be correctly handled by the UTF-8 conversion. I will now proceed to filter these records for `protocol` = 2 and normalize the `permitRootLogin` values.",
  "plan": "1. Use `awk` to filter records where the `protocol` is '2'. 2. Within the same `awk` command, implement the normalization rules for the `permitRootLogin` column: 'prohibit-password' to 'without-password' and 'forced-commands-only' to 'no'. 3. The output will be saved to an intermediate file for further processing towards the deliverables.",
