You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Systems Engineering Task: Legacy Audit Normalization

You have been assigned to clean up a data dump from a decommissioned mainframe bastion host. The data is critical for an upcoming security audit. The previous engineer left abruptly, leaving behind a raw CSV file and a mapping configuration.

## 1. Environment & Inputs

Your working directory is `/home/user/inventory`. You will find two files:

1.  `ssh_audit.csv`: The raw audit log. 
    *   **WARNING:** This file was generated by a legacy ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) system. It contains special characters (e.g., in the 'location' or 'owner' fields) that are not valid UTF-8. You must handle this encoding correctly during processing.
    *   The file structure is: `serverName,port,permitRootLogin,protocol,owner,extra`
    *   Lines starting with `#` are comments. However, due to a bug in the mainframe exporter, some comment lines have leading whitespace (e.g., `  # comment`). These must also be ignored.

2.  `legacy_map.conf`: A renaming configuration file.
    *   Format: `old_hostname -> new_hostname`
    *   If a `serverName` from the CSV appears on the left side of an arrow in this file, you must output the `new_hostname` in all generated files.

## 2. Processing Logic

Using **standard shell utilities only** (sed, awk, grep, sort, iconv, tr, cut, etc. are allowed; **NO** Python, Perl, Ruby, or C compiled code), generate the files described below.

### Global Filtering & Transformation Rules
1.  **Encoding:** Convert all output data to UTF-8, except where specified otherwise.
2.  **Protocol Security:** Only include records where `protocol` is `2`. 
    *   *Exception:* If the server was renamed via `legacy_map.conf`, it is considered a "legacy node" and `protocol` `1` is also permitted for it.
3.  **Root Login:** Normalize the `permitRootLogin` column:
    *   `prohibit-password` becomes `without-password`.
    *   `forced-commands-only` becomes `no`.

## 3. Deliverables

Create the following three files in `/home/user/inventory`. Pay extreme attention to the encoding and line-ending requirements for each.

a) `ssh_root_status.txt`
   *   **Format:** `serverName | permitRootLogin` (pipe surrounded by spaces).
   *   **Sorting:** Alphabetical by `serverName` (A-Z).
   *   **Line Endings:** This file is for a Windows-based dashboard. It must use **CRLF** (`\r\n`) line endings.
   *   **Header:** None.

b) `ssh_priority.tsv`
   *   **Format:** Tab-separated values.
   *   **Columns:** `port`, `serverName`, `owner`.
   *   **Sorting:** Primary sort by `port` (numeric ascending). Secondary sort by `serverName` (descending Z-A).
   *   **Header:** The first line must be the literal string `#PRIORITY_LIST` followed by a newline.
   *   **Encoding:** This file must be encoded in **UTF-16LE** with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to be compatible with Excel import tools.

c) `audit_manifest.json`
   *   **Format:** A strict JSON object containing the row counts of the processed data.
   *   **Content:** `{"valid_records": N, "legacy_nodes_detected": M}`
       *   `N`: Total number of lines in `ssh_root_status.txt`.
       *   `M`: Number of servers that were renamed using the mapping file.
   *   **Formatting:** The JSON must be on a single line with no spaces between keys/values (e.g., `{"key":value}`).

## 4. Verification Log

Create `/home/user/task_logs/column_manipulation.log`.
*   This log tracks the *provenance* of the data.
*   Format: `ISO_TIMESTAMP | COMMAND`
*   **Crucial Requirement:** The timestamp used in this log must NOT be the current execution time. It must be the **Last Modification Time** of the source file (`ssh_audit.csv`) in ISO-8601 UTC format (e.g., `2023-11-05T08:00:00Z`). This links the output to the specific source version.
*   Log the commands used to generate the three deliverables (3 lines total).

## Success Criteria
*   All files exist at exact paths.
*   Encodings (Latin-1 input, UTF-16LE output, CRLF endings) are handled perfectly.
*   Renaming logic from the mapping file is applied.
*   Log timestamps match the source file's mtime, not current time.
