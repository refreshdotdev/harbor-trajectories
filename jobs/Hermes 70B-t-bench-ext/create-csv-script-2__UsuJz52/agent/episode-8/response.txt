The next step is to create the 'audit_manifest.json' file which needs to contain the row counts: total valid records (which will be the line count of 'ssh_root_status.txt') and legacy nodes detected (which will be 0 since there are no renaming rules). The JSON must be on a single line with no spaces.",

I'll create the JSON file with the counts in the required format. Finally, I'll create the verification log file with the source file's last modification time timestamp and log the commands used for provenance tracking.",
