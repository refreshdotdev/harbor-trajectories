The previous ad-hoc reporting method is no longer audit-compliant. You need to build a robust, multi-stage pipeline script (`generate_cost_report.sh`) that ingests raw logs, sanitizes them, models the costs with our new regional tax rules, and produces a final legacy-compatible report.\n\n## 1. Input Data Sources\n\nThe data is located in `/home/user/container_usage/`. Note that we are in the middle of a migration, so you will see multiple files. **Do not use the old `owners.csv` file**; it is deprecated. Use the new v2 export from the Windows Active Directory system (`owners_v2.csv`).\n\n1.  **Usage Log** (`usage.log`):\n    - Standard UTF-8 CSV.\n    - Columns: `container_id,image,cpu_percent,mem_mb,runtime_hours,cost_per_hour`.\n    - **Data Quality Warning:** Some sensors are misfiring. You may find string literals like \"NULL\" or \"N/A\" in numeric columns (`cpu_percent`, `mem_mb`). Treat these as `0`. Lines starting with `#` are comments.\n\n2.  **Owners Registry** (`owners_v2.csv`):\n    - This is a raw export from the new Windows-based system.\n    - **Format:** It uses Semicolons (`;`) as delimiters, not commas.\n    - **Encoding:** It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** with a BOM. You must handle this correctly.\n    - Columns: `container_id;owner_email;environment;region`.\n\n## 2. The Pipeline Specification\n\nYour script must execute three distinct phases. All intermediate artifacts must be saved to `/home/user/data/` (create this directory if it doesn't exist).\n\n### Phase 1: Ingestion & Sanitization\nRead `usage.log`. Filter out comments. Sanitize any \"NULL\"/\"N/A\" values to `0`. Save the clean, normalized data to:\n`/home/user/data/clean_usage.csv`\n*Format: Standard CSV (comma-delimited), UTF-8, Header included.*\n\n### Phase 2: Enrichment & Cost Modeling\nRead `clean_usage.csv` and merge it with `owners_v2.csv` on `container_id`. If a container is not found in the owners file, assume Owner=\"Unknown\", Env=\"prod\", Region=\"global\".\n\n**Cost Calculation Logic:**\nWe have new business rules. Calculate costs in this specific order:\n1.  **Base Cost:** `runtime_hours * cost_per_hour`.\n2.  **Regional Tax:** Apply tax to the Base Cost based on the `region` column:\n    - `eu-west`: Add **10%** tax.\n    - `us-east`: **0%** tax (tax-free zone).\n    - All other regions (including \"global\"): Add **5%** tax.\n3.  **Environment Discount:** After adding tax, check the `environment`. If it is exactly `dev`, apply a **50% discount** to the *taxed* amount.\n\n*Rounding: Round the final cost to 4 decimal places for the JSON model.*\n\n**Idle Detection:**\nA container is \"Idle\" if `cpu_percent` <= 5.0 **AND** `mem_mb` < 512. (Note: High memory usage implies active caching, so it's not idle even if CPU is low).\n\n**Output:**\nGenerate a JSON file at `/home/user/data/cost_model.json`. \nStructure:\n```json\n{\n  \"_meta\": {\n    \"generated\": \"<ISO-8601 Timestamp>\",\n    \"source_hash\": \"<SHA256 checksum of clean_usage.csv>\"\n  },\n  \"data\": [\n    { \"container_id\": \"...\", \"total_cost\": 12.3456, \"is_idle\": true, ... },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n*The `source_hash` is critical for our audit chain. It must be the lowercase hex digest of the Phase 1 output file.*\n\n### Phase 3: Final Reporting\nRead the JSON model from Phase 2 and generate the human-readable report at:\n`/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt`\n\n**Critical Constraint:** The finance mainframe that ingests this report requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for the final text report.\n\n**Report Layout:**\n```text\nFinOps Cost Report (v2)\nDate: YYYY-MM-DD\n\nContainer | Region | Tax | Cost\n---------------------------------\n<rows sorted by Cost Descending>\n\nSummary\n=======\nActive Containers: <int>\nIdle Containers: <int>\nTotal Cost: $<float with 2 decimals>\n\n[Integrity Hash: <MD5 checksum of cost_model.json>]\n```\n\n**Formatting Rules:**\n- The table columns are pipe-separated but aligned? No, just pipe-delimited: `id | region | tax_rate | final_cost`.\n- `tax_rate` should be displayed as a percentage (e.g., `10%`, `5%`, `0%`).\n- `final_cost` in the table: 2 decimal places.\n- The footer `[Integrity Hash: ...]` must contain the MD5 hex digest of the `cost_model.json` file generated in Phase 2. This ensures the report matches the JSON model exactly.\n\n## 3. Deliverables\n\n1.  `/home/user/bin/generate_cost_report.sh` (Executable, POSIX-compliant entry point).\n2.  `/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt` (The final output).\n3.  The intermediate files in `/home/user/data/` must exist after execution.\n\nThe script should handle arguments: if no argument is provided, write to the default path. If a file path is provided as output, write the report there (and still generate the intermediates in `~/data/`).\n\nGood luck. The auditors are watching.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0a2420fe-fc93-4111-856f-d3cbc843a217:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sanitize any \"NULL\"/\"N/A\" values to `0`. Save the clean, normalized data to:\n`/home/user/data/clean_usage.csv`\n*Format: Standard CSV (comma-delimited), UTF-8, Header included.*\n\n### Phase 2: Enrichment & Cost Modeling\nRead `clean_usage.csv` and merge it with `owners_v2.csv` on `container_id`. If a container is not found in the owners file, assume Owner=\"Unknown\", Env=\"prod\", Region=\"global\".\n\n**Cost Calculation Logic:**\nWe have new business rules. Calculate costs in this specific order:\n1.  **Base Cost:** `runtime_hours * cost_per_hour`.\n2.  **Regional Tax:** Apply tax to the Base Cost based on the `region` column:\n    - `eu-west`: Add **10%** tax.\n    - `us-east`: **0%** tax (tax-free zone).\n    - All other regions (including \"global\"): Add **5%** tax.\n3.  **Environment Discount:** After adding tax, check the `environment`. If it is exactly `dev`, apply a **50% discount** to the *taxed* amount.\n\n*Rounding: Round the final cost to 4 decimal places for the JSON model.*\n\n**Idle Detection:**\nA container is \"Idle\" if `cpu_percent` <= 5.0 **AND** `mem_mb` < 512. (Note: High memory usage implies active caching, so it's not idle even if CPU is low).\n\n**Output:**\nGenerate a JSON file at `/home/user/data/cost_model.json`. \nStructure:\n```json\n{\n  \"_meta\": {\n    \"generated\": \"<ISO-8601 Timestamp>\",\n    \"source_hash\": \"<SHA256 checksum of clean_usage.csv>\"\n  },\n  \"data\": [\n    { \"container_id\": \"...\", \"total_cost\": 12.3456, \"is_idle\": true, ... },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n*The `source_hash` is critical for our audit chain. It must be the lowercase hex digest of the Phase 1 output file.*\n\n### Phase 3: Final Reporting\nRead the JSON model from Phase 2 and generate the human-readable report at:\n`/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt`\n\n**Critical Constraint:** The finance mainframe that ingests this report requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for the final text report.\n\n**Report Layout:**\n```text\nFinOps Cost Report (v2)\nDate: YYYY-MM-DD\n\nContainer | Region | Tax | Cost\n---------------------------------\n<rows sorted by Cost Descending>\n\nSummary\n=======\nActive Containers: <int>\nIdle Containers: <int>\nTotal Cost: $<float with 2 decimals>\n\n[Integrity Hash: <MD5 checksum of cost_model.json>]\n```\n\n**Formatting Rules:**\n- The table columns are pipe-separated but aligned? No, just pipe-delimited: `id | region | tax_rate | final_cost`.\n- `tax_rate` should be displayed as a percentage (e.g., `10%`, `5%`, `0%`).\n- `final_cost` in the table: 2 decimal places.\n- The footer `[Integrity Hash: ...]` must contain the MD5 hex digest of the `cost_model.json` file generated in Phase 2. This ensures the report matches the JSON model exactly.\n\n## 3. Deliverables\n\n1.  `/home/user/bin/generate_cost_report.sh` (Executable, POSIX-compliant entry point).\n2.  `/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt` (The final output).\n3.  The intermediate files in `/home/user/data/` must exist after execution.\n\nThe script should handle arguments: if no argument is provided, write to the default path. If a file path is provided as output, write the report there (and still generate the intermediates in `~/data/`).\n\nGood luck. The auditors are watching.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0a2420fe-fc93-4111-856f-d3cbc843a217:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The system is currently in a default state (root shell in home directory), and no prior work from this task has been done. I need to create a script that processes container usage data through three distinct phases: ingestion and sanitization, enrichment and cost modeling, and final reporting. Key challenges include handling different file formats (CSV, UTF-16LE with BOM), performing complex cost calculations with regional tax rules and environment discounts, detecting idle containers, and generating outputs in specific formats (JSON and ISO-8859-1 encoded text). The script must also be POSIX-compliant and handle command-line arguments.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"I will approach this task in several stages. First, I'll create the necessary directory structure and begin building the script piece by piece. I'll start by creating the `/home/user/data/` directory for intermediate files. Then I'll create the main script file at `/home/user/bin/generate_cost_report.sh` and make it executable. I'll then implement each phase of the pipeline incrementally: 1) Ingestion and sanitization of `usage.log`, 2) Enrichment and cost modeling by joining with `owners_v2.csv`, and 3) Final reporting generation. I'll use a combination of shell scripting, awk for data processing, and jq for JSON manipulation. I'll also implement argument handling so the script can take an optional output file path.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/data\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/bin\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > /home/user/bin/generate_cost_report.sh << 'EOF'\\\\n#!/bin/bash\\\\n\\\\n# FinOps Cost Reporting Pipeline v2\\\\n# This script processes container usage data through multiple stages\\\\n\\\\nset -eo pipefail\\\\n\\\\nSCRIPT_NAME=$(basename \\\\\\\"$0\\\\\\\")\\\\nDEFAULT_REPORT_PATH=\\\\\\\"/home/user/container_usage/cost_report.txt\\\\\\\"\\\\nUSAGE_LOG=\\\\\\\"/home/user/container_usage/usage.log\\\\\\\"\\\\nOWNERS_V2_CSV=\\\\\\\"/home/user/container_usage/owners_v2.csv\\\\\\\"\\\\nINTERMEDIATE_DIR=\\\\\\\"/home/user/data\\\\\\\"\\\\nCLEAN_USAGE_CSV=\\\\\\\"$INTERMEDIATE_DIR/clean_usage.csv\\\\\\\"\\\\nJSON_MODEL=\\\\\\\"$INTERMEDIATE_DIR/cost_model.json\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Phase 1 - Ingestion & Sanitization\\\\n# Input: usage.log (UTF-8 CSV with comments and NULL/N/A values)\\\\n# Output: clean_usage.csv (UTF-8 CSV with sanitized numeric values)\\\\necho \\\\\\\"=== PHASE 1: Ingestion & Sanitization ===\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# Create clean_usage.csv with header\\\\n# Filter out comment lines, sanitize NULL/N/A to 0 in numeric fields\\\\nawk -F, 'BEGIN { \\\\n    print \\\\\\\"container_id,image,cpu_percent,mem_mb,runtime_hours,cost_per_hour\\\\\\\" \\\\n}\\\\n!/^#/ { \\\\n    # Sanitize numeric fields - treat NULL/N/A as 0\\\\n    if ($3 ~ /^[0-9.]+$/ || $3 == \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" || $3 == \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" || $3 == \\\\\\\"NULL\\\\\\\") gsub(/[A-Za-z]/, \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", $3)\\\\n    if ($4 ~ /^[0-9.]+$/ || $4 == \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" || $4 == \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" || $4 == \\\\\\\"NULL\\\\\\\") gsub(/[A-Za-z]/, \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", $4)\\\\n    if ($5 ~ /^[0-9.]+$/ || $5 == \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" || $5 == \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" || $5 == \\\\\\\"NULL\\\\\\\") gsub(/[A-Za-z]/, \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", $5)\\\\n    if ($6 ~ /^[0-9.]+$/ || $6 == \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" || $6 == \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" || $6 == \\\\\\\"NULL\\\\\\\") gsub(/[A-Za-z]/, \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", $6)\\\\n    \\\\n    # Convert empty strings to 0 after sanitization\\\\n    $3 = ($3 == \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\") ?
