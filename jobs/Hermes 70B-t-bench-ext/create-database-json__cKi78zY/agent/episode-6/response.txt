  "analysis": "The attempt to fix the `sqlparse` import by inserting `import sqlparse` into the `extract_table_and_columns` function using `sed` caused an `IndentationError`. This is because the inserted line was not properly indented to match Python's syntax requirements. The script failed to run, and the `report.json` remains unchanged from the previous successful run (which still had `null` index suggestions).",
  "plan": "I will fix the `IndentationError` by correcting the `sed` command to ensure the `import sqlparse` statement is properly indented within the function. I'll use a more robust `sed` approach or manually edit the file if the `sed` command becomes too complex. After fixing the indentation, I will re-run the script. The goal is to get the `extract_table_and_columns` function working correctly so that index suggestions are generated.",
