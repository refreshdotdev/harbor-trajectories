  "analysis": "I've analyzed the current state. The system is a Linux environment, and I'm logged in as root. The task requires processing SQL files in `/home/user/db_backups`, normalizing them, compressing them, and generating compliance reports. I need to read the Batch ID from `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf`. I should first check if the backup directory and config file exist, then proceed with the processing pipeline.",
  "plan": "My plan involves the following steps:\n1. Navigate to the `/home/user` directory.\n2. Check if the backup directory (`/home/user/db_backups`) exists. If not, create it.\n3. Check if the backup logs directory (`/home/user/backup_logs`) exists. If not, create it.\n4. Read the Batch ID from the system-wide config file at `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf`, trimming any trailing newlines.\n5. Process each `.sql` file in the backup directory:\n   a. Strip UTF-8 BOM if present.\n   b. Trim trailing whitespace from every line.\n   c. Capture normalized content and its size.\n   d. Compress normalized content to `.gz` file with current timestamp.\n   e. Remove original `.sql` file.\n   f. Record sizes and hash for reporting.\n6. Generate `manifest.json` with filename to normalized size mapping.\n7. Generate `compliance_report.log` with proper encoding (ISO-8859-1), Windows line endings (CRLF), and sorted records (custom collation for underscores vs hyphens).\n8. Calculate SHA256 hash of `manifest.json` for the compliance report footer.",
