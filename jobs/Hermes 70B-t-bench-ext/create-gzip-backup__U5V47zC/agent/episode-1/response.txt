  "analysis": "Good progress. I've verified the directory structure:\n1. `/home/user/db_backups` contains several `.sql` files, including some with spaces in filenames and a decoy config file.\n2. `/home/user/backup_logs` directory was created successfully.\n3. The system-wide config file `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf` exists and contains the Batch ID: \"BID-PROD-8821\".\n\nThe next step is to process each SQL file by normalizing it, compressing it, and collecting data for the manifest and compliance report.",
  "plan": "I will now process each SQL file in `/home/user/db_backups`. For each file:\n1.  Normalize: Remove UTF-8 BOM and trim trailing whitespace from each line.\n2.  Capture normalized content and its size.\n3.  Compress normalized content to `.gz` file and set its modification time to current.\n4.  Remove original `.sql` file.\n5.  Record filename, normalized size, gzipped size, and MD5 hash of normalized content.\n6.  Store this data in a temporary file for later report generation.\n\nI'll use a Python script for precise byte-level operations and to handle special characters in filenames.",
