            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a DevOps engineer tasked with modernizing a legacy database backup pipeline. The previous engineer left abruptly, and the current backup script is failing to meet the strict compliance standards required by the auditing team.\n\nYour goal is to process the raw SQL dumps in `/home/user/db_backups`, normalize them, compress them, and generate a specific compliance report.\n\n## 1. Input State\nThe directory `/home/user/db_backups` contains several `.sql` files. \n- Some files may be read-only.\n- Some filenames may contain leading/trailing spaces or unusual characters.\n- There are configuration files scattered around, but you must ignore the decoy `batch_config.txt` located in the backup directory. The **authoritative** Batch ID is located in the system-wide configuration file at `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf`.\n\n## 2. Processing Requirements\nYou must write a script to process every `.sql` file in the directory (and ONLY `.sql` files). For each file:\n\n1.  **Normalization**: The raw SQL dumps were generated by a tool that occasionally inserts Byte Order Marks (BOM) and trailing whitespace. You must:\n    -   Strip any UTF-8 BOM if present at the start of the file.\n    -   Trim trailing whitespace from *every individual line* of the file.\n    -   **Important**: This normalized content is what must be compressed and hashed. Do not compress the raw dirty file.\n\n2.  **Compression**: \n    -   Compress the *normalized* content using gzip.\n    -   The output file must be named `<original_filename>.gz`. For example, if the file is named ` data.sql` (with a leading space), the output must be ` data.sql.gz`.\n    -   Remove the original `.sql` file after successful compression.\n    -   Ensure the file modification time of the `.gz` file is set to the current time.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\nYou must generate two artifacts in a new directory `/home/user/backup_logs/`.\n\n### Artifact A: The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\nA JSON object mapping the exact filename (as it appears on disk) to the **normalized** uncompressed size in bytes.\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"customers.sql\": 1024,\n  \" orders.sql\": 512\n}\n```\n\n### Artifact B: The Compliance Report (`compliance_report.log`)\nThis is a legacy format consumed by a mainframe. It has strict encoding rules:\n-   **Encoding**: ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n-   **Line Endings**: Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`).\n\nThe file format is as follows:\n\n**Line 1**: Header\n`BATCH: <Batch_ID_From_Config>`\n(Note: If the Batch ID in the config file has trailing newlines, trim them).\n\n**Lines 2..N**: File Records\nOne line per processed file, formatted as:\n`FILE: <filename> | N_SIZE: <bytes> | GZ_SIZE: <bytes> | MD5: <hash>`\n\n-   `N_SIZE`: Size of the normalized content.\n-   `GZ_SIZE`: Size of the final .gz file.\n-   `MD5`: MD5 hash of the **normalized** content.\n\n**Sorting Rule**:\nThe records must be sorted by filename using a custom legacy collation:\n-   Sort is case-insensitive.\n-   However, underscores (`_`) must take precedence over hyphens (`-`). In standard ASCII, `-` comes before `_`. You must reverse this specific precedence so that `data_v1.sql` comes *before* `data-v1.sql`.\n\n**Footer Line**:\n`MANIFEST_SHA256: <sha256_hash_of_the_manifest_json_file>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  `/home/user/db_backups/` should contain only `.gz` files (and any non-sql files that were already there).\n2.  `/home/user/backup_logs/manifest.json` must exist.\n3.  `/home/user/backup_logs/compliance_report.log` must exist, be encoded in Latin-1 with CRLF, and contain the correct hash of the manifest file.\n\n## Constraints\n-   You do not have root access.\n-   You must use standard Linux tools or Python 3 (installed).\n-   Do not modify non-SQL files in the backup directory.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@65828d79-39a2-4a26-86c7-82bbffd02509:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a DevOps engineer tasked with modernizing a legacy database backup pipeline. The previous engineer left abruptly, and the current backup script is failing to meet the strict compliance standards required by the auditing team.\n\nYour goal is to process the raw SQL dumps in `/home/user/db_backups`, normalize them, compress them, and generate a specific compliance report.\n\n## 1. Input State\nThe directory `/home/user/db_backups` contains several `.sql` files. \n- Some files may be read-only.\n- Some filenames may contain leading/trailing spaces or unusual characters.\n- There are configuration files scattered around, but you must ignore the decoy `batch_config.txt` located in the backup directory. The **authoritative** Batch ID is located in the system-wide configuration file at `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf`.\n\n## 2. Processing Requirements\nYou must write a script to process every `.sql` file in the directory (and ONLY `.sql` files). For each file:\n\n1.  **Normalization**: The raw SQL dumps were generated by a tool that occasionally inserts Byte Order Marks (BOM) and trailing whitespace. You must:\n    -   Strip any UTF-8 BOM if present at the start of the file.\n    -   Trim trailing whitespace from *every individual line* of the file.\n    -   **Important**: This normalized content is what must be compressed and hashed. Do not compress the raw dirty file.\n\n2.  **Compression**: \n    -   Compress the *normalized* content using gzip.\n    -   The output file must be named `<original_filename>.gz`. For example, if the file is named ` data.sql` (with a leading space), the output must be ` data.sql.gz`.\n    -   Remove the original `.sql` file after successful compression.\n    -   Ensure the file modification time of the `.gz` file is set to the current time.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\nYou must generate two artifacts in a new directory `/home/user/backup_logs/`.\n\n### Artifact A: The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\nA JSON object mapping the exact filename (as it appears on disk) to the **normalized** uncompressed size in bytes.\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"customers.sql\": 1024,\n  \" orders.sql\": 512\n}\n```\n\n### Artifact B: The Compliance Report (`compliance_report.log`)\nThis is a legacy format consumed by a mainframe. It has strict encoding rules:\n-   **Encoding**: ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n-   **Line Endings**: Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`).\n\nThe file format is as follows:\n\n**Line 1**: Header\n`BATCH: <Batch_ID_From_Config>`\n(Note: If the Batch ID in the config file has trailing newlines, trim them).\n\n**Lines 2..N**: File Records\nOne line per processed file, formatted as:\n`FILE: <filename> | N_SIZE: <bytes> | GZ_SIZE: <bytes> | MD5: <hash>`\n\n-   `N_SIZE`: Size of the normalized content.\n-   `GZ_SIZE`: Size of the final .gz file.\n-   `MD5`: MD5 hash of the **normalized** content.\n\n**Sorting Rule**:\nThe records must be sorted by filename using a custom legacy collation:\n-   Sort is case-insensitive.\n-   However, underscores (`_`) must take precedence over hyphens (`-`). In standard ASCII, `-` comes before `_`. You must reverse this specific precedence so that `data_v1.sql` comes *before* `data-v1.sql`.\n\n**Footer Line**:\n`MANIFEST_SHA256: <sha256_hash_of_the_manifest_json_file>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  `/home/user/db_backups/` should contain only `.gz` files (and any non-sql files that were already there).\n2.  `/home/user/backup_logs/manifest.json` must exist.\n3.  `/home/user/backup_logs/compliance_report.log` must exist, be encoded in Latin-1 with CRLF, and contain the correct hash of the manifest file.\n\n## Constraints\n-   You do not have root access.\n-   You must use standard Linux tools or Python 3 (installed).\n-   Do not modify non-SQL files in the backup directory.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@65828d79-39a2-4a26-86c7-82bbffd02509:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a DevOps engineer tasked with modernizing a legacy database backup pipeline. The previous engineer left abruptly, and the current backup script is failing to meet the strict compliance standards required by the auditing team.\n\nYour goal is to process the raw SQL dumps in `/home/user/db_backups`, normalize them, compress them, and generate a specific compliance report.\n\n## 1. Input State\nThe directory `/home/user/db_backups` contains several `.sql` files. \n- Some files may be read-only.\n- Some filenames may contain leading/trailing spaces or unusual characters.\n- There are configuration files scattered around, but you must ignore the decoy `batch_config.txt` located in the backup directory. The **authoritative** Batch ID is located in the system-wide configuration file at `/home/user/.config/backup_system.conf`.\n\n## 2. Processing Requirements\nYou must write a script to process every `.sql` file in the directory (and ONLY `.sql` files). For each file:\n\n1.  **Normalization**: The raw SQL dumps were generated by a tool that occasionally inserts Byte Order Marks (BOM) and trailing whitespace. You must:\n    -   Strip any UTF-8 BOM if present at the start of the file.\n    -   Trim trailing whitespace from *every individual line* of the file.\n    -   **Important**: This normalized content is what must be compressed and hashed. Do not compress the raw dirty file.\n\n2.  **Compression**: \n    -   Compress the *normalized* content using gzip.\n    -   The output file must be named `<original_filename>.gz`. For example, if the file is named ` data.sql` (with a leading space), the output must be ` data.sql.gz`.\n    -   Remove the original `.sql` file after successful compression.\n    -   Ensure the file modification time of the `.gz` file is set to the current time.\n\n## 3. Reporting Requirements\nYou must generate two artifacts in a new directory `/home/user/backup_logs/`.\n\n### Artifact A: The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\nA JSON object mapping the exact filename (as it appears on disk) to the **normalized** uncompressed size in bytes.\nExample:\n```json\n{\n  \"customers.sql\": 1024,\n  \" orders.sql\": 512\n}\n```\n\n### Artifact B: The Compliance Report (`compliance_report.log`)\nThis is a legacy format consumed by a mainframe. It has strict encoding rules:\n-   **Encoding**: ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n-   **Line Endings**: Windows-style CRLF (`\\r\\n`).\n\nThe file format is as follows:\n\n**Line 1**: Header\n`BATCH: <Batch_ID_From_Config>`\n(Note: If the Batch ID in the config file has trailing newlines, trim them).\n\n**Lines 2..N**: File Records\nOne line per processed file, formatted as:\n`FILE: <filename> | N_SIZE: <bytes> | GZ_SIZE: <bytes> | MD5: <hash>`\n\n-   `N_SIZE`: Size of the normalized content.\n-   `GZ_SIZE`: Size of the final .gz file.\n-   `MD5`: MD5 hash of the **normalized** content.\n\n**Sorting Rule**:\nThe records must be sorted by filename using a custom legacy collation:\n-   Sort is case-insensitive.\n-   However, underscores (`_`) must take precedence over hyphens (`-`). In standard ASCII, `-` comes before `_`. You must reverse this specific precedence so that `data_v1.sql` comes *before* `data-v1.sql`.\n\n**Footer Line**:\n`MANIFEST_SHA256: <sha256_hash_of_the_manifest_json_file>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n1.  `/home/user/db_backups/` should contain only `.gz` files (and any non-sql files that were already there).\n2.  `/home/user/backup_logs/manifest.json` must exist.\n3.  `/home/user/backup_logs/compliance_report.log` must exist, be encoded in Latin-1 with CRLF, and contain the correct hash of the manifest file.\n\n## Constraints\n-   You do not have root access.\n-   You must use standard Linux tools or Python 3 (installed).\n-   Do not modify non-SQL files in the backup directory.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@65828d79-39a2-4a26-86c7-82bbffd02509:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
