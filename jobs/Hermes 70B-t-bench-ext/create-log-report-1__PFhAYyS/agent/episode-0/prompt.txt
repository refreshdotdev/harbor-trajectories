You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
<task_name>create-log-report-1</task_name>

<instruction>
You are a security engineer performing a rigorous “credential-rotation” sweep on a Python project. The team’s policy has tightened: you must set up a specifically identifiable environment, ensure specific tooling is present while removing build artifacts, and generate a cryptographically verifiable, tamper-proof audit trail.

Your assignment:

1. **Environment Setup**
   * Create a brand-new virtual environment at `/home/user/cred_rotate_env`.
   * **Constraint**: To clearly distinguish this environment in logs, it must be created with the custom prompt `(cred_rotate)`.
   * Use the standard `venv` module. Do **not** rely on root privileges.

2. **Package Management**
   * Activate the environment.
   * Install the specific library `requests==2.31.0`.
   * Uninstall the package named **wheel**.
     • The uninstall must succeed without errors.
     • After the uninstall, package **wheel** must no longer be reported by `pip freeze`.

3. **Audit Snapshot**
   * Create an audit snapshot of the environment at:
     `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/after_uninstall_freeze.txt`
   * This file must contain the exact, unmodified output of the `pip freeze` command.
   * **Content Rules**:
     • Plain text lines produced by `pip freeze` (one package per line).
     • Must include `requests==2.31.0` and its dependencies.
     • No line may start with “wheel==”.
     • The order must be exactly whatever `pip freeze` produces.

4. **Integrity & Security**
   * Generate a SHA256 checksum for the audit snapshot and save it to:
     `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/freeze.sha256`
   * **Format**: The checksum file must contain the hash followed by the filename (e.g., `hash  after_uninstall_freeze.txt`). It must use the relative filename only (no directory path) so that `sha256sum -c freeze.sha256` works when run inside the `rotation_logs` directory.
   * **Permissions**: To prevent tampering, change the file permissions for both `after_uninstall_freeze.txt` and `freeze.sha256` to **read-only for the owner (0400)** (and no permissions for group/others).

Summary of the expected final state:
• Valid virtualenv at `/home/user/cred_rotate_env` with prompt `(cred_rotate)`.
• `requests==2.31.0` installed; `wheel` uninstalled.
• Directory `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/` exists.
• `after_uninstall_freeze.txt` exists, is read-only (0400), matches `pip freeze` exactly.
• `freeze.sha256` exists, is read-only (0400), and validates the freeze file.
