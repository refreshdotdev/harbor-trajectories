      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n<task_name>create-log-report-1</task_name>\n\n<instruction>\nYou are a security engineer performing a rigorous \u201ccredential-rotation\u201d sweep on a Python project. The team\u2019s policy has tightened: you must set up a specifically identifiable environment, ensure specific tooling is present while removing build artifacts, and generate a cryptographically verifiable, tamper-proof audit trail.\n\nYour assignment:\n\n1. **Environment Setup**\n   * Create a brand-new virtual environment at `/home/user/cred_rotate_env`.\n   * **Constraint**: To clearly distinguish this environment in logs, it must be created with the custom prompt `(cred_rotate)`.\n   * Use the standard `venv` module. Do **not** rely on root privileges.\n\n2. **Package Management**\n   * Activate the environment.\n   * Install the specific library `requests==2.31.0`.\n   * Uninstall the package named **wheel**.\n     \u2022 The uninstall must succeed without errors.\n     \u2022 After the uninstall, package **wheel** must no longer be reported by `pip freeze`.\n\n3. **Audit Snapshot**\n   * Create an audit snapshot of the environment at:\n     `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/after_uninstall_freeze.txt`\n   * This file must contain the exact, unmodified output of the `pip freeze` command.\n   * **Content Rules**:\n     \u2022 Plain text lines produced by `pip freeze` (one package per line).\n     \u2022 Must include `requests==2.31.0` and its dependencies.\n     \u2022 No line may start with \u201cwheel==\u201d.\n     \u2022 The order must be exactly whatever `pip freeze` produces.\n\n4. **Integrity & Security**\n   * Generate a SHA256 checksum for the audit snapshot and save it to:\n     `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/freeze.sha256`\n   * **Format**: The checksum file must contain the hash followed by the filename (e.g., `hash  after_uninstall_freeze.txt`). It must use the relative filename only (no directory path) so that `sha256sum -c freeze.sha256` works when run inside the `rotation_logs` directory.\n   * **Permissions**: To prevent tampering, change the file permissions for both `after_uninstall_freeze.txt` and `freeze.sha256` to **read-only for the owner (0400)** (and no permissions for group/others).\n\nSummary of the expected final state:\n\u2022 Valid virtualenv at `/home/user/cred_rotate_env` with prompt `(cred_rotate)`.\n\u2022 `requests==2.31.0` installed; `wheel` uninstalled.\n\u2022 Directory `/home/user/cred_rotate_env/rotation_logs/` exists.\n\u2022 `after_uninstall_freeze.txt` exists, is read-only (0400), matches `pip freeze` exactly.\n\u2022 `freeze.sha256` exists, is read-only (0400), and validates the freeze file.\n</instruction>\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c48e7145-d3d9-4371-9373-d72c796cc439:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
