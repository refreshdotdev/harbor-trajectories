I am now in the `/home/user/datasets` directory, which is the correct location for executing the main processing script. The next step is to process the files from `/home/user/datasets/raw` recursively, applying the specified rules for categorization, collision handling, and logging.",
  "plan": "I will run a comprehensive `find` command to process every file in `/home/user/datasets/raw` recursively, in alphabetical order. For each file, I will perform the following actions based on the priority rules: 1. Skip any broken symbolic links and files with no permissions. 2. For PNG files larger than 1,000,000 bytes, move them to the `png_large` directory. 3. For JPG files with a modification time before 1625097600, copy them to the `jpg_old` directory. 4. For other regular files less than or equal to 512,000 bytes (excluding .txt files), copy them to the `misc_small` directory. If a file with the target name already exists in the destination folder, the incoming file will be renamed using the format `{stem}_{parent_folder_name}.{extension}`. After processing, I will append the details to the log file and update the counters. Finally, I will sort the log file by the `new_absolute_path` column and generate the summary JSON file.",
