Output Hierarchy\nCreate an output hierarchy `/home/user/datasets/organized` with **exactly** these items:\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/png_large`\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/jpg_old`\n*   Directory: `/home/user/datasets/organized/misc_small`\n*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`\n*   File: `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json`\n\n### 2. File Selection & Priority Rules\nProcess every file in `/home/user/datasets/raw` (recursively). To ensure deterministic behavior, you must process source files in **alphabetical order of their absolute paths**.\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Skip any broken symbolic links.\n*   Skip any files with permission mode `000` (no permissions).\n\n**Categories (Priority Order):**\n1.  **png_large**: Move every `*.png` file strictly larger than **1,000,000 bytes**.\n2.  **jpg_old**: Copy (preserve attributes) every `*.jpg` file with a modification time strictly before Unix Epoch **1625097600** (July 1, 2021).\n3.  **misc_small**: Copy (preserve attributes) every remaining regular file (any extension) that is **\u2264 512,000 bytes** AND does **not** have a `.txt` extension.\n\n### 3. Collision Handling\nPreserve filenames generally. However, if a file with the target name *already exists* in the destination folder (due to a file from an earlier processed source directory):\n*   Rename the **current** incoming file to: `{stem}_{parent_folder_name}.{extension}`\n*   *Example:* If `img.png` exists, and you are processing `.../projectB/img.png`, the new name becomes `img_projectB.png`.\n\n### 4. Logging & Reporting\n\n**A) TSV Log**\nCreate a tab-separated log at `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`.\n*   Columns: `original_path`, `new_absolute_path`, `size_bytes`, `mtime_epoch`, `md5_hash`\n*   `size_bytes` and `mtime_epoch` must match the destination file.\n*   `md5_hash` is the MD5 checksum of the file content.\n*   The file must be **sorted alphabetically** by the `new_absolute_path` column.\n*   No header line.\n\n**B) Summary JSON**\nCreate a JSON file at `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json` containing exactly these keys:\n```json\n{\n  \"moved_count\": <integer>,\n  \"copied_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer>\n}\n```\n*   `moved_count`: Number of files moved (Rule 1).\n*   `copied_count`: Number of files copied (Rules 2 & 3).\n*   `total_bytes`: Sum of the size (in bytes) of all resulting files in the organized folders.\n\n### Verification Hints\n*   Moved PNGs must no longer exist in `raw`.\n*   Copied files must still exist in `raw`.\n*   Timestamps on copied files must match their originals.\n*   Ensure your collision logic uses the immediate parent directory name of the source file.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@4ae6d2bb-a43d-4ccf-939c-1c831a251b49:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are helping a researcher tidy-up a scattered image dataset that lives under `/home/user/datasets/raw`.\n\n### 1.

File Selection & Priority Rules\nProcess every file in `/home/user/datasets/raw` (recursively). To ensure deterministic behavior, you must process source files in **alphabetical order of their absolute paths**.\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Skip any broken symbolic links.\n*   Skip any files with permission mode `000` (no permissions).\n\n**Categories (Priority Order):**\n1.  **png_large**: Move every `*.png` file strictly larger than **1,000,000 bytes**.\n2.  **jpg_old**: Copy (preserve attributes) every `*.jpg` file with a modification time strictly before Unix Epoch **1625097600** (July 1, 2021).\n3.  **misc_small**: Copy (preserve attributes) every remaining regular file (any extension) that is **\u2264 512,000 bytes** AND does **not** have a `.txt` extension.\n\n### 3. Collision Handling\nPreserve filenames generally. However, if a file with the target name *already exists* in the destination folder (due to a file from an earlier processed source directory):\n*   Rename the **current** incoming file to: `{stem}_{parent_folder_name}.{extension}`\n*   *Example:* If `img.png` exists, and you are processing `.../projectB/img.png`, the new name becomes `img_projectB.png`.\n\n### 4. Logging & Reporting\n\n**A) TSV Log**\nCreate a tab-separated log at `/home/user/datasets/organized/organize_log.tsv`.\n*   Columns: `original_path`, `new_absolute_path`, `size_bytes`, `mtime_epoch`, `md5_hash`\n*   `size_bytes` and `mtime_epoch` must match the destination file.\n*   `md5_hash` is the MD5 checksum of the file content.\n*   The file must be **sorted alphabetically** by the `new_absolute_path` column.\n*   No header line.\n\n**B) Summary JSON**\nCreate a JSON file at `/home/user/datasets/organized/summary.json` containing exactly these keys:\n```json\n{\n  \"moved_count\": <integer>,\n  \"copied_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer>\n}\n```\n*   `moved_count`: Number of files moved (Rule 1).\n*   `copied_count`: Number of files copied (Rules 2 & 3).\n*   `total_bytes`: Sum of the size (in bytes) of all resulting files in the organized folders.\n\n### Verification Hints\n*   Moved PNGs must no longer exist in `raw`.\n*   Copied files must still exist in `raw`.\n*   Timestamps on copied files must match their originals.\n*   Ensure your collision logic uses the immediate parent directory name of the source file.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@4ae6d2bb-a43d-4ccf-939c-1c831a251b49:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
