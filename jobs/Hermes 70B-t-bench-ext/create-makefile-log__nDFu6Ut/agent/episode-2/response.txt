  "analysis": "There were critical errors in the previous Makefile creation due to incorrect escaping of `$` characters within the heredoc. The shell interpreted `LOG_DIR` and `$${LOG_FILE}` as commands instead of Makefile variables. The Makefile was not created correctly, leading to a 'command not found' error and a 'missing separator' error when `make` was run. I need to re-create the Makefile with proper escaping for Make variables (`$$` for a single `$` in the Makefile).",
  "plan": "I will first remove the incorrectly created `Makefile` (if any partial file was created). Then, I will carefully recreate the `Makefile` using `cat > Makefile << EOF ... EOF` but this time ensuring all `$` characters that are part of Makefile syntax (e.g., in variable names like `$(VAR)` or for shell commands executed from make like `$$(command)`) are correctly escaped as `$$` within the heredoc. After creating the Makefile, I will run `make` again.",
