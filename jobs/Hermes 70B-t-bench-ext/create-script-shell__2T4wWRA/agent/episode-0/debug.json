Your goal is to demonstrate robust process-management practices, handle signals correctly, manage file permissions securely, and maintain detailed logs.\n\n*   **Environment Setup**:\n    *   Create a directory `/home/user/training_pipeline`.\n    *   Note the value of the environment variable `PIPELINE_ID` (which is pre-set in your environment).\n\n*   **Script Creation**:\n    *   Inside that directory, create the Python file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess_data.py`. Use the standard library only.\n    *   The script must:\n        1.  Read the `PIPELINE_ID` environment variable.\n        2.  Set up a signal handler for `SIGUSR1`. When this signal is received, the script must write exactly \"Received signal, stopping.\" to **STDERR** (not stdout), and then immediately exit with exit code **42**.\n        3.  In the main loop, write the line \u201c[`PIPELINE_ID`] working \u2026\u201d to **STDOUT** (e.g., `[AX-99] working \u2026`) once every second.\n        4.  Sleep for one second after each write.\n        5.  Repeat this ten (10) times. If the loop completes without interruption (which should not happen in this exercise), exit with code 0.\n    *   **Security**: The script file must be accessible *only* by the owner. Set its permissions to `700` (rwx------).\n\n*   **Execution**:\n    *   Start the script as a background job with a user-space priority (nice) value of exactly 5.\n    *   Redirect STDOUT to a temporary file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.out`.\n    *   Redirect STDERR to a temporary file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.err`.\n    *   Record the numeric PID.\n\n*   **Process Summary**:\n    *   While the script is still running, create the text file `/home/user/training_pipeline/process_summary.txt`.\n    *   This file must be **read-only** for everyone (permissions `444` or r--r--r--) once created.\n    *   It must contain exactly these nine (9) lines in this order:\n\n    ```\n    script_name: preprocess_data.py\n    script_md5: <32-character MD5 checksum of preprocess_data.py>\n    initial_nice: 5\n    pid_recorded: yes\n    pipeline_id: <value of PIPELINE_ID>\n    was_running: yes\n    terminated_signal: SIGUSR1\n    exit_code: 42\n    summary: interrupted\n    ```\n    *   Calculate the MD5 checksum dynamically from the file you created.\n    *   `was_running` must be \u201cyes\u201d iff you observed the process running.\n\n*   **Termination**:\n    *   Terminate the running script by sending it the `SIGUSR1` signal. **Do not** use SIGKILL or SIGTERM.\n    *   Wait for the process to exit and ensure it is no longer in the process table.\n\n*   **Log Assembly**:\n    *   Create the final log file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.log` by concatenating the contents of `preprocess.out` followed by `preprocess.err`.\n    *   Finally, append the single line `Process finished.` to the very end of `preprocess.log`.\n    *   Remove the temporary `.out` and `.err` files.\n\n*   **Artefacts**:\n    *   Leave `preprocess_data.py`, `preprocess.log`, and `process_summary.txt` in `/home/user/training_pipeline`.\n\nThe automated test will verify file existence, permissions (700 for script, 444 for summary), content accuracy (including correct MD5, PIPELINE_ID, and log merging), and that the process handled the signal correctly (exit code 42).\n\nDo not display the contents of any secret files in your terminal output.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b8ad9bfe-14f4-4014-b45b-074ed1b963c3:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The working directory is the home directory `/root`. I need to set up the `training_pipeline` environment, create the Python script with specific signal handling and logging, execute it, manage its process, and finally generate the summary and log files as per the requirements.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"First, I will navigate to the `/home/user` directory and create the `training_pipeline` subdirectory. Then, I will create the Python script `preprocess_data.py` inside this new directory, setting its permissions to `700` immediately. Next, I'll record the `PIPELINE_ID` environment variable and calculate the MD5 checksum of the script. I will then start the script in the background with a nice value of 5, redirecting its output and error streams to temporary files and recording its PID. After verifying it's running, I'll create the `process_summary.txt` file with the required details and set its permissions to `444`. Following this, I'll send the `SIGUSR1` signal to the script to terminate it and wait for its completion. Finally, I'll assemble the main log file by concatenating the temporary output and error files, append a final status line, and clean up the temporary files.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd /home/user\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir training_pipeline\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd training_pipeline\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"script_content=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"import os\\\\nimport sys\\\\nimport time\\\\nimport signal\\\\n\\\\nPIPELINE_ID = os.getenv('PIPELINE_ID', 'ENV_VAR_NOT_SET')\\\\n\\\\nreceived_signal = False\\\\n\\\\ndef signal_handler(sig, frame):\\\\n    global received_signal\\\\n    #
