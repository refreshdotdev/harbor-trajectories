You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a machine-learning engineer who has drafted a small Python script to simulate a time-consuming data-pre-processing step. Your goal is to demonstrate robust process-management practices, handle signals correctly, manage file permissions securely, and maintain detailed logs.

*   **Environment Setup**:
    *   Create a directory `/home/user/training_pipeline`.
    *   Note the value of the environment variable `PIPELINE_ID` (which is pre-set in your environment).

*   **Script Creation**:
    *   Inside that directory, create the Python file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess_data.py`. Use the standard library only.
    *   The script must:
        1.  Read the `PIPELINE_ID` environment variable.
        2.  Set up a signal handler for `SIGUSR1`. When this signal is received, the script must write exactly "Received signal, stopping." to **STDERR** (not stdout), and then immediately exit with exit code **42**.
        3.  In the main loop, write the line “[`PIPELINE_ID`] working …” to **STDOUT** (e.g., `[AX-99] working …`) once every second.
        4.  Sleep for one second after each write.
        5.  Repeat this ten (10) times. If the loop completes without interruption (which should not happen in this exercise), exit with code 0.
    *   **Security**: The script file must be accessible *only* by the owner. Set its permissions to `700` (rwx------).

*   **Execution**:
    *   Start the script as a background job with a user-space priority (nice) value of exactly 5.
    *   Redirect STDOUT to a temporary file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.out`.
    *   Redirect STDERR to a temporary file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.err`.
    *   Record the numeric PID.

*   **Process Summary**:
    *   While the script is still running, create the text file `/home/user/training_pipeline/process_summary.txt`.
    *   This file must be **read-only** for everyone (permissions `444` or r--r--r--) once created.
    *   It must contain exactly these nine (9) lines in this order:

    ```
    script_name: preprocess_data.py
    script_md5: <32-character MD5 checksum of preprocess_data.py>
    initial_nice: 5
    pid_recorded: yes
    pipeline_id: <value of PIPELINE_ID>
    was_running: yes
    terminated_signal: SIGUSR1
    exit_code: 42
    summary: interrupted
    ```
    *   Calculate the MD5 checksum dynamically from the file you created.
    *   `was_running` must be “yes” iff you observed the process running.

*   **Termination**:
    *   Terminate the running script by sending it the `SIGUSR1` signal. **Do not** use SIGKILL or SIGTERM.
    *   Wait for the process to exit and ensure it is no longer in the process table.

*   **Log Assembly**:
    *   Create the final log file `/home/user/training_pipeline/preprocess.log` by concatenating the contents of `preprocess.out` followed by `preprocess.err`.
    *   Finally, append the single line `Process finished.` to the very end of `preprocess.log`.
    *   Remove the temporary `.out` and `.err` files.

*   **Artefacts**:
    *   Leave `preprocess_data.py`, `preprocess.log`, and `process_summary.txt` in `/home/user/training_pipeline`.

The automated test will verify file existence, permissions (700 for script, 444 for summary), content accuracy (including correct MD5, PIPELINE_ID, and log merging), and that the process handled the signal correctly (exit code 42).

Do not display the contents of any secret files in your terminal output.
