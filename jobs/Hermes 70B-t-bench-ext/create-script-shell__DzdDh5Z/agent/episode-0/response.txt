  "plan": "First, I will check if the PIPELINE_ID environment variable exists. Then, I'll create the `/home/user/training_pipeline` directory. After that, I will create the Python script `preprocess_data.py` with the specified logic for signal handling, logging, and looping. I need to ensure the script has the correct permissions (700). Subsequently, I'll execute the script in the background with nice value 5, redirecting its output to temporary files and recording its PID. While it's running, I'll create the `process_summary.txt` file with dynamic values for MD5 checksum and PIPELINE_ID, and set its permissions to 444. I'll then send SIGUSR1 to the script and wait for it to terminate. Finally, I'll assemble the final log file, clean up temporary files, and verify the remaining artifacts.",
