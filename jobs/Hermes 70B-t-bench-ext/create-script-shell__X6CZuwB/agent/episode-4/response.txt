  "analysis": "The process summary file `process_summary.txt` has been created successfully with the correct content and permissions (444). However, I notice that the Python script process (PID 688) finished prematurely. The script was designed to run for 10 one-second iterations (totaling 10 seconds), but it completed before the 3-second sleep I introduced. The `[1]+ Done` message indicates that the script exited on its own, which means it didn't encounter the `SIGUSR1` signal as planned. This is an issue because the termination requirements specify using `SIGUSR1` and expect an exit code of 42. I need to address this by restarting the script properly and then sending the signal.",
  "plan": "First, I'll verify the current process status and check the output files to understand why the script might have terminated early (though it's likely because the 10-second runtime naturally completed). Then, I'll restart the script in the background with the same parameters. After confirming it's running, I'll send the `SIGUSR1` signal to it. Finally, I'll wait for it to exit and then complete the remaining log assembly tasks.",
