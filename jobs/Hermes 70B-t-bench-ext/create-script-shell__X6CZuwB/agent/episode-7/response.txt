  "analysis": "Excellent! The process with PID 870 has successfully terminated with an exit code of 42, which confirms that the `SIGUSR1` signal was handled correctly by the script. The `ps` command also confirms that the process is no longer running. All intermediate files (`preprocess.out`, `preprocess.err`, and `process_summary.txt`) are in place with correct permissions. The final step is to assemble the final log file.",
  "plan": "I will concatenate the contents of `preprocess.out` and `preprocess.err` into a new file called `preprocess.log`. Then, I'll append the line 'Process finished.' to the end of `preprocess.log`. Finally, I'll remove the temporary `preprocess.out` and `preprocess.err` files, leaving only the required artefacts: `preprocess_data.py`, `preprocess.log`, and `process_summary.txt`.",
