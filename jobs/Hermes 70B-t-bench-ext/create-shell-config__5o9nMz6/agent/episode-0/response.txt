  "plan": "My plan involves several steps:\n1. Navigate to the project directory\n2. Prepare for audit logging by recording the original version.txt hash\n3. Calculate the new version number by parsing version.txt, stripping BOM, incrementing MINOR, and computing PATCH based on label ASCII sum + magic_offset\n4. Generate the new version.txt with ISO-8859-1 encoding and no trailing newline\n5. Process release_notes.json to create a properly formatted changelog section\n6. Prepend the new changelog section to CHANGELOG.md and convert the entire file to CRLF line endings\n7. Create distribution directory and generate SHA256 checksum map with uppercase filenames\n8. Complete audit logging with the final version.txt hash",
