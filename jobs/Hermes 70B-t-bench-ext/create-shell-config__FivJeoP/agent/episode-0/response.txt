  "analysis": "The current environment is a Linux terminal. The task requires several build/release operations for the 'Hardener' security toolkit, with specific constraints for a legacy Windows-based downstream system (OldGuard). Key requirements include handling BOM in version.txt, calculating entropy-based PATCH numbers, ISO-8859-1 encoding, CRLF line endings, and specific formatting for changelogs and checksum manifests.",
  "plan": "I will approach this task in sequential steps:\n1. Navigate to the project directory and establish an audit log.\n2. Calculate the new version number by processing version.txt (handling BOM), extracting label, calculating ASCII entropy, and reading magic_offset.\n3. Update version.txt with the new version string in ISO-8859-1 encoding with no trailing newline.\n4. Generate the new changelog section from release_notes.json, sorting items by length (descending) and alphabetically, then prepend to CHANGELOG.md and convert the entire file to CRLF line endings.\n5. Create the distribution manifest dist/release.map with SHA256 checksums for VERSION.TXT and CHANGELOG.md in uppercase.\n6. Complete the audit log with the final hash of the new version.txt.",
