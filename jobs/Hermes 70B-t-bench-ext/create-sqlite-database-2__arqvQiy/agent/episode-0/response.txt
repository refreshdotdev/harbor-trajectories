  "analysis": "I've received the task description and the initial terminal state showing I'm in the `/home/user/cmtracker` directory. No prior work has been done. I need to start from scratch, following all phases of the project: sanitization, database initialization, simulation, and reporting.",
  "plan": "I will begin Phase 1 by creating the necessary directories (`configs`, `db`, `logs`, `reports`) and then populate them with the required files. After setting up the environment, I'll perform the sanitization tasks: converting line endings for `ssh.cfg`, changing encoding for `nginx.conf`, removing trailing whitespace from `app.ini`, and deleting excluded files. Once sanitization is complete, I'll proceed to Phase 2 to initialize the SQLite database and load the initial state of the files. After that, I'll execute Phase 3 simulation tasks (prepending a line to `ssh.cfg` and changing permissions of `nginx.conf`) and log the corresponding events. Finally, I'll generate the audit report in Phase 4 and ensure the SQL log contains the integrity checksum.",
