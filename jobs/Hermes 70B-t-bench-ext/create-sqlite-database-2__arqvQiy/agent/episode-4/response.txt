The `sed` command for removing trailing whitespace from `app.ini` and the `rm` command for deleting excluded files both executed successfully. I need to handle the line ending conversion for `ssh.cfg` using an alternative method since `dos2unix` is unavailable.",
  "plan": "I will use `sed` with a literal CRLF replacement to convert Windows line endings to Unix line endings for `ssh.cfg`. I'll also verify the file encoding for `nginx.conf` using an alternative command if `file` is not available, or proceed assuming UTF-8 as originally created. After these adjustments, I'll move on to Phase 2: initializing the SQLite database.",
