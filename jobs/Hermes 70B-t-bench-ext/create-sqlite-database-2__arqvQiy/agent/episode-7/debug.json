Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why?

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Project: Legacy Configuration Audit & Tracker\n\n**TO:** Engineering Team\n**FROM:** SysAdmin Lead\n**SUBJECT:** Urgent cleanup and tracking of legacy configs\n\nWe have inherited a messy directory of configuration files from the previous team. Your task is to write a robust automation script (Bash/Python) to sanitize these files, initialize a SQLite tracking database, perform a simulated maintenance task, and generate a signed audit report.\n\n## 1. Workspace & Pre-requisites\n\nWorking directory: `/home/user/cmtracker`\n\nWe have dumped the raw configuration files into `/home/user/cmtracker/configs`.\n**WARNING:** These files are dirty. They come from different systems (Windows, Legacy Unix) and have encoding/formatting issues.\n\nYou will also find a file at `/home/user/version.txt` which contains the current audit version string (e.g., `v2.0-RC1`). You will need this for the report header.\n\n## 2. Phase 1: Sanitization (Critical)\n\nBefore tracking anything, you must modify the files in `/home/user/cmtracker/configs` **in-place** to meet our strict standards.\n\n*   **`ssh.cfg`**: This file came from a Windows box. It has CRLF line endings. Convert it to standard Linux LF line endings.\n*   **`nginx.conf`**: This file is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) and contains a copyright symbol. Convert it to **UTF-8** while preserving the special character.\n*   **`app.ini`**: This file has sloppy trailing whitespace. Remove all trailing whitespace characters from every line.\n*   **Exclusions**: Delete any file ending in `.bak` or starting with a dot (`.`). Do not track them.\n\n*Note: All subsequent steps must operate on these sanitized versions.*\n\n## 3. Phase 2: Database Initialization\n\nCreate a SQLite database at `/home/user/cmtracker/db/audit.db`.\n\nWe need two tables. Please infer the column types appropriate for the data described.\n\n**Table: `tracked_files`**\n*   `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `rel_path`: Relative path from the configs directory (e.g., `ssh.cfg`, not the full path).\n*   `file_hash`: **SHA-256** hash of the sanitized file content.\n*   `magic_hex`: The first 4 bytes of the file, represented as a lowercase hex string (e.g., `504b0304`).\n*   `size_bytes`: File size in bytes.\n\n**Table: `audit_events`**\n*   `event_id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `file_id`: Foreign key to `tracked_files`.\n*   `event_type`: Text (must be 'INIT', 'MODIFY', or 'PERM').\n*   `event_ts`: ISO-8601 Timestamp (UTC).\n\n**Initial Load:**\nPopulate the database with the current state of all sanitized files in `configs`. Create a corresponding 'INIT' event for each file using the file's current modification timestamp.\n\n## 4. Phase 3: Simulation\n\nPerform exactly these steps in order:\n\n1.  **Prepend** the line `# URGENT SECURITY PATCH` to the very **top** of `ssh.cfg`. (Do not append it to the end!).\n    *   Update the `tracked_files` record (hash, magic_hex, size).\n    *   Log a 'MODIFY' event in `audit_events` using the new mtime.\n\n2.  Wait 1 second.\n\n3.  **Change permissions** of `nginx.conf` to `400` (read-only, user only).\n    *   Log a 'PERM' event in `audit_events`. Use the current UTC time for this event.\n    *   *Note: The `tracked_files` table does not track permissions, so no update is needed there.*\n\n## 5. Phase 4: Reporting & Logging\n\n**The Report**\nGenerate a summary report at `/home/user/cmtracker/reports/audit_summary.csv`.\n\n*   **Format:** Semicolon-delimited (`;`).\n*   **Header:** Must be exactly: `PATH;EVENT;HASH;VERSION=<content of version.txt>`\n*   **Sorting:** Sort primarily by `event_type` (Alphabetical), and secondarily by `rel_path` (Alphabetical).\n*   **Content:** Rows should contain the relative path, event type, and the file hash associated with that file record.\n\n**The SQL Log**\nLog all SQL commands to `/home/user/cmtracker/logs/sql_history.log`.\n\n**Integrity Check (The Trap):**\nTo prevent tampering, the **very last line** of your `sql_history.log` must be a comment containing the SHA-256 checksum of the final `audit.db` file.\n\nFormat:\n`-- DB_CHECKSUM: <sha256_hex_of_db_file>`\n\n(You must calculate this checksum *after* all DB operations are complete and the connection is closed, then append it to the log.)\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e535d4ff-2e66-427a-ade1-d8e01430a6f3:/home/user/cmtracker#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why?

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Project: Legacy Configuration Audit & Tracker\n\n**TO:** Engineering Team\n**FROM:** SysAdmin Lead\n**SUBJECT:** Urgent cleanup and tracking of legacy configs\n\nWe have inherited a messy directory of configuration files from the previous team. Your task is to write a robust automation script (Bash/Python) to sanitize these files, initialize a SQLite tracking database, perform a simulated maintenance task, and generate a signed audit report.\n\n## 1. Workspace & Pre-requisites\n\nWorking directory: `/home/user/cmtracker`\n\nWe have dumped the raw configuration files into `/home/user/cmtracker/configs`.\n**WARNING:** These files are dirty. They come from different systems (Windows, Legacy Unix) and have encoding/formatting issues.\n\nYou will also find a file at `/home/user/version.txt` which contains the current audit version string (e.g., `v2.0-RC1`). You will need this for the report header.\n\n## 2. Phase 1: Sanitization (Critical)\n\nBefore tracking anything, you must modify the files in `/home/user/cmtracker/configs` **in-place** to meet our strict standards.\n\n*   **`ssh.cfg`**: This file came from a Windows box. It has CRLF line endings. Convert it to standard Linux LF line endings.\n*   **`nginx.conf`**: This file is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) and contains a copyright symbol. Convert it to **UTF-8** while preserving the special character.\n*   **`app.ini`**: This file has sloppy trailing whitespace. Remove all trailing whitespace characters from every line.\n*   **Exclusions**: Delete any file ending in `.bak` or starting with a dot (`.`). Do not track them.\n\n*Note: All subsequent steps must operate on these sanitized versions.*\n\n## 3. Phase 2: Database Initialization\n\nCreate a SQLite database at `/home/user/cmtracker/db/audit.db`.\n\nWe need two tables. Please infer the column types appropriate for the data described.\n\n**Table: `tracked_files`**\n*   `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `rel_path`: Relative path from the configs directory (e.g., `ssh.cfg`, not the full path).\n*   `file_hash`: **SHA-256** hash of the sanitized file content.\n*   `magic_hex`: The first 4 bytes of the file, represented as a lowercase hex string (e.g., `504b0304`).\n*   `size_bytes`: File size in bytes.\n\n**Table: `audit_events`**\n*   `event_id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `file_id`: Foreign key to `tracked_files`.\n*   `event_type`: Text (must be 'INIT', 'MODIFY', or 'PERM').\n*   `event_ts`: ISO-8601 Timestamp (UTC).\n\n**Initial Load:**\nPopulate the database with the current state of all sanitized files in `configs`. Create a corresponding 'INIT' event for each file using the file's current modification timestamp.\n\n## 4. Phase 3: Simulation\n\nPerform exactly these steps in order:\n\n1.  **Prepend** the line `# URGENT SECURITY PATCH` to the very **top** of `ssh.cfg`. (Do not append it to the end!).\n    *   Update the `tracked_files` record (hash, magic_hex, size).\n    *   Log a 'MODIFY' event in `audit_events` using the new mtime.\n\n2.  Wait 1 second.\n\n3.  **Change permissions** of `nginx.conf` to `400` (read-only, user only).\n    *   Log a 'PERM' event in `audit_events`. Use the current UTC time for this event.\n    *   *Note: The `tracked_files` table does not track permissions, so no update is needed there.*\n\n## 5. Phase 4: Reporting & Logging\n\n**The Report**\nGenerate a summary report at `/home/user/cmtracker/reports/audit_summary.csv`.\n\n*   **Format:** Semicolon-delimited (`;`).\n*   **Header:** Must be exactly: `PATH;EVENT;HASH;VERSION=<content of version.txt>`\n*   **Sorting:** Sort primarily by `event_type` (Alphabetical), and secondarily by `rel_path` (Alphabetical).\n*   **Content:** Rows should contain the relative path, event type, and the file hash associated with that file record.\n\n**The SQL Log**\nLog all SQL commands to `/home/user/cmtracker/logs/sql_history.log`.\n\n**Integrity Check (The Trap):**\nTo prevent tampering, the **very last line** of your `sql_history.log` must be a comment containing the SHA-256 checksum of the final `audit.db` file.\n\nFormat:\n`-- DB_CHECKSUM: <sha256_hex_of_db_file>`\n\n(You must calculate this checksum *after* all DB operations are complete and the connection is closed, then append it to the log.)\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e535d4ff-2e66-427a-ade1-d8e01430a6f3:/home/user/cmtracker#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration.

Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Project: Legacy Configuration Audit & Tracker\n\n**TO:** Engineering Team\n**FROM:** SysAdmin Lead\n**SUBJECT:** Urgent cleanup and tracking of legacy configs\n\nWe have inherited a messy directory of configuration files from the previous team. Your task is to write a robust automation script (Bash/Python) to sanitize these files, initialize a SQLite tracking database, perform a simulated maintenance task, and generate a signed audit report.\n\n## 1. Workspace & Pre-requisites\n\nWorking directory: `/home/user/cmtracker`\n\nWe have dumped the raw configuration files into `/home/user/cmtracker/configs`.\n**WARNING:** These files are dirty. They come from different systems (Windows, Legacy Unix) and have encoding/formatting issues.\n\nYou will also find a file at `/home/user/version.txt` which contains the current audit version string (e.g., `v2.0-RC1`). You will need this for the report header.\n\n## 2. Phase 1: Sanitization (Critical)\n\nBefore tracking anything, you must modify the files in `/home/user/cmtracker/configs` **in-place** to meet our strict standards.\n\n*   **`ssh.cfg`**: This file came from a Windows box. It has CRLF line endings. Convert it to standard Linux LF line endings.\n*   **`nginx.conf`**: This file is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) and contains a copyright symbol. Convert it to **UTF-8** while preserving the special character.\n*   **`app.ini`**: This file has sloppy trailing whitespace. Remove all trailing whitespace characters from every line.\n*   **Exclusions**: Delete any file ending in `.bak` or starting with a dot (`.`). Do not track them.\n\n*Note: All subsequent steps must operate on these sanitized versions.*\n\n## 3. Phase 2: Database Initialization\n\nCreate a SQLite database at `/home/user/cmtracker/db/audit.db`.\n\nWe need two tables. Please infer the column types appropriate for the data described.\n\n**Table: `tracked_files`**\n*   `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `rel_path`: Relative path from the configs directory (e.g., `ssh.cfg`, not the full path).\n*   `file_hash`: **SHA-256** hash of the sanitized file content.\n*   `magic_hex`: The first 4 bytes of the file, represented as a lowercase hex string (e.g., `504b0304`).\n*   `size_bytes`: File size in bytes.\n\n**Table: `audit_events`**\n*   `event_id`: Auto-incrementing primary key.\n*   `file_id`: Foreign key to `tracked_files`.\n*   `event_type`: Text (must be 'INIT', 'MODIFY', or 'PERM').\n*   `event_ts`: ISO-8601 Timestamp (UTC).\n\n**Initial Load:**\nPopulate the database with the current state of all sanitized files in `configs`. Create a corresponding 'INIT' event for each file using the file's current modification timestamp.\n\n## 4. Phase 3: Simulation\n\nPerform exactly these steps in order:\n\n1.  **Prepend** the line `# URGENT SECURITY PATCH` to the very **top** of `ssh.cfg`. (Do not append it to the end!).\n    *   Update the `tracked_files` record (hash, magic_hex, size).\n    *   Log a 'MODIFY' event in `audit_events` using the new mtime.\n\n2.  Wait 1 second.\n\n3.  **Change permissions** of `nginx.conf` to `400` (read-only, user only).\n    *   Log a 'PERM' event in `audit_events`. Use the current UTC time for this event.\n    *   *Note: The `tracked_files` table does not track permissions, so no update is needed there.*\n\n## 5. Phase 4: Reporting & Logging\n\n**The Report**\nGenerate a summary report at `/home/user/cmtracker/reports/audit_summary.csv`.\n\n*   **Format:** Semicolon-delimited (`;`).\n*   **Header:** Must be exactly: `PATH;EVENT;HASH;VERSION=<content of version.txt>`\n*   **Sorting:** Sort primarily by `event_type` (Alphabetical), and secondarily by `rel_path` (Alphabetical).\n*   **Content:** Rows should contain the relative path, event type, and the file hash associated with that file record.\n\n**The SQL Log**\nLog all SQL commands to `/home/user/cmtracker/logs/sql_history.log`.\n\n**Integrity Check (The Trap):**\nTo prevent tampering, the **very last line** of your `sql_history.log` must be a comment containing the SHA-256 checksum of the final `audit.db` file.\n\nFormat:\n`-- DB_CHECKSUM: <sha256_hex_of_db_file>`\n\n(You must calculate this checksum *after* all DB operations are complete and the connection is closed, then append it to the log.)\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e535d4ff-2e66-427a-ade1-d8e01430a6f3:/home/user/cmtracker#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
