On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds.

I've dumped everything into `/home/user/evidence/`. There might be some old rotated logs in subdirectories there too. \n\nI need you to generate a clean CSV report of the attackers. The legal team is very specific about the format this time because they're feeding it into a legacy mainframe.\n\n### Phase 1: Sanitation\nFirst, the logs are a mess. Some corrupted binary data got mixed in. You need to create a single consolidated log file at `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`. This file must contain the text content of **all** the evidence logs (both plain text and compressed `.gz` files), but you **must** strip out any lines containing null bytes (`\\x00`) or other non-printable control characters (ASCII 0-31), except for newlines and tabs. Ensure the final file is strictly UTF-8, replacing any invalid byte sequences from the source files with a replacement character ().\n\n### Phase 2: Analysis\nRead your cleaned log file. We are looking for \"Failed password\" events. \n\nHowever, we only care about attacks on high ports. The specific port threshold is defined in the configuration file located at `/home/user/.config/ir_settings.ini` under the `[Filters]` section. **Do not hardcode the port number**; read it from the config.\n\n### Phase 3: The Report\nGenerate a report at `/home/user/out/report.csv`.\n\n**Data Format Requirements (Read Carefully):**\n1. **Time Normalization**: The logs are in the server's local time (EST, which is UTC-5). The report must list timestamps in **UTC** ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Assume the year is **2023** for all entries.\n2. **Columns**: The columns are `IP`, `First_Seen_UTC`, and `Attempt_Count`.\n   - `First_Seen_UTC` is the timestamp of the *earliest* valid attack found for that IP.\n3. **Delimiters**: This is the weird part. The **header row** must use **commas** (`,`) as the delimiter. The **data rows** must use **semicolons** (`;`) as the delimiter. (Don't ask, it's for the legacy importer).\n4. **Sorting**: Sort the list by `Attempt_Count` (descending). If the counts are equal, break ties by `First_Seen_UTC` (descending / most recent first).\n\n### Phase 4: Chain of Custody\nFinally, to ensure integrity, generate a SHA-1 checksum of your final `report.csv` and save it to `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`. The file should contain only the hex hash, no filenames.\n\n**Summary of Deliverables:**\n- `/home/user/out/cleaned_combined.log`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv`\n- `/home/user/out/report.csv.sha1`\n\nGood luck.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@e1f59613-b6d2-4259-a1f4-9cbc37a4ad3d:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
