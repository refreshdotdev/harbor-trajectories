1. First, examine the evidence directory structure to understand what logs I'm working with
2. Create the output directory structure
3. Process all log files (both plain text and compressed) while sanitizing the content
4. Extract the port threshold from the configuration file
5. Parse the cleaned logs to identify relevant attack patterns
6. Generate the report with the specific formatting requirements
7. Create the SHA-1 checksum for chain of custody",
