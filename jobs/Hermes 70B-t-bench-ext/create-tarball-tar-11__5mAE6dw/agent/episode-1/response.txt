  "analysis": "The Python script `backup_legacy.py` has been created and executed. The script output indicates that the backup process started, the `/home/user/backups` directory was created, and it proceeded to create the archive. However, the execution was interrupted (likely by the system prompt timing out or a manual interruption, as indicated by the subsequent commands appearing before the script could finish). The final verification commands (`echo`, `ls`, `wc`) were also not fully processed. The task is therefore not yet complete.",
  "plan": "My plan is to re-run the Python script `backup_legacy.py` to ensure all backup, manifest, and summary file generation steps are completed. After the script finishes, I will verify the outputs by listing the contents of the `backups` directory and checking the line counts for the manifest and summary files.",
