You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
A configuration-manager wants to keep version-stamped backups of application configuration files living under `/home/user/configs`.

**Environment Setup**

*   The directory `/home/user/configs` contains various configuration files in a nested structure.
*   A file `/home/user/backup_id` contains a string identifier for the current backup (e.g., `v1.2-2023`).

**Goal**

Create a bash script that performs the following tasks. Your solution must ensure the directories `/home/user/backups` and `/home/user/backup_logs` exist.

### 1. Identify and Filter Files

Scan `/home/user/configs` recursively for files to backup. You must **only** process files that meet **all** of the following criteria:
*   The file extension is either `.conf` or `.yml`.
*   The file size is **512 bytes or less**.
*   The file is NOT named `test.conf` (in any directory).

(Note: Some filenames may contain spaces.)

### 2. Create Individual Archives (Parallel)

For each valid file found, create a separate compressed archive in `/home/user/backups`. These jobs must run in **parallel** (background jobs).

*   **Naming Convention**: `<basename>_<BACKUP_ID>.tar.<ext>`
    *   `<basename>` is the filename without the extension (e.g., `my config.yml` → `my config`).
    *   `<BACKUP_ID>` is the content read from `/home/user/backup_id` (trim any whitespace).
    *   You may assume all valid files have unique basenames.
*   **Compression Rules**:
    *   If the source file is `.conf`, use **gzip** compression. Result extension: `.tar.gz`.
    *   If the source file is `.yml`, use **bzip2** compression. Result extension: `.tar.bz2`.
*   **Pathing**: Each archive must store the file keeping its path **relative** to `/home/user/configs`. For example, if backing up `/home/user/configs/subdir/app.conf`, the archive should contain `subdir/app.conf` (no leading `./` or `/`).

### 3. Create Full Archive

After all individual backups are finished, create one top-level archive:
*   Path: `/home/user/backups/configs_full_<BACKUP_ID>.tar.xz`
*   Content: The entire `/home/user/configs` directory tree (preserving relative paths).
*   Compression: **XZ** (use `tar -J` or similar).

### 4. Generate Log File

Generate a machine-verifiable log file at `/home/user/backup_logs/backup_<BACKUP_ID>.log`.

*   **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `REL_PATH|ARCHIVE_NAME|SHA256|SIZE`
*   **Content**: One line per valid file backed up.
*   **Format**: Pipe-delimited columns:
    1.  `REL_PATH`: Path of the file relative to `/home/user/configs`.
    2.  `ARCHIVE_NAME`: The filename of the created archive (e.g., `app_v1.2.tar.gz`).
    3.  `SHA256`: The SHA-256 checksum of the original source file.
    4.  `SIZE`: The size of the original source file in bytes.
*   **Sorting**: The lines (excluding the header) must be sorted by the **SHA256 column** (ascending).

**Example Log Content**:
```text
REL_PATH|ARCHIVE_NAME|SHA256|SIZE
subdir/my config.yml|my config_v1.0.tar.bz2|3e1d44...|420
app.conf|app_v1.0.tar.gz|7b4639...|120
```

**Requirements**:
*   The script must return exit code 0.
*   Handle spaces in filenames correctly.
*   Do not hardcode filenames; discover them dynamically.
*   Ensure correct compression algorithms are applied.
