  "analysis": "The backup script has executed successfully. The `/home/user/backups` directory contains individual archives for each valid configuration file (app.conf, another.conf, my config.yml, db.yml, duplicate_name.conf) and a full archive (configs_full_v1.2-2023.tar.xz). The script correctly excluded `test.conf` and `large.yml`, and handled filenames with spaces (`my config.yml`). The log file `/home/user/backup_logs/backup_v1.2-2023.log` contains the expected header and 12 data lines (13 total lines), which matches the number of processed files. The next step is to perform more detailed verification of the archive content and log file format.",
  "plan": "1. Check the content of one individual archive to verify that it contains the correct file with the proper relative path. 2. Verify the compression of the individual archives (gzip for .conf, bzip2 for .yml). 3. Check the content of the full archive to ensure it contains the entire configurations directory tree. 4. Examine the log file to confirm that it is sorted by the SHA256 column and has the correct pipe-delimited format.",
