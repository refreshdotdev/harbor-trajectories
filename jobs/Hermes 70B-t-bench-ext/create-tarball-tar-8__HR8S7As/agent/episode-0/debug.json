Your team has received a bundle of application logs that must be pre-processed before being fed into an old IBM mainframe system (`System-Z`).\n\nYour task is to write a bash script that extracts specific error logs, redacts sensitive information based on dynamic configuration, and generates a summary report formatted strictly for the mainframe's ingestion interface.\n\n### Input Data\n\n1.  **Log Archive**: Located at `/home/user/datasets/log_archive.tar.gz`.\n    *   This archive contains a directory tree of log files.\n    *   **Filtering Rule**: You must process **ONLY** the files whose filenames start with `prod-` (e.g., `prod-api.log`). Ignore `dev-`, `test-`, or any other prefixes. Ignore any files not in the top-level `logs/` directory of the archive.\n    *   **Log Format**: Each line is UTF-8 text: `YYYY-MM-DD\u2409HH:MM:SS\u2409LEVEL\u2409MODULE\u2409MESSAGE` (tab-separated).\n\n2.  **Configuration**: Located at `/home/user/config/settings.json`.\n    *   This JSON file contains critical parameters for your processing logic, including the redaction placeholder and the required output encoding.\n\n### Output Artifacts\n\nAll outputs must be placed in `/home/user/clean_data/` (create if missing).\n\n#### 1. The Mainframe Log (`/home/user/clean_data/mainframe_errors.log`)\n\n*   **Content**: Include only lines where LEVEL is `ERROR` and MODULE is `DataCleaner`.\n*   **Redaction**: The MESSAGE field contains email addresses. You must replace ALL email addresses with the **exact string value** found in the `redaction_label` key of `settings.json`. \n    *   *Note*: Do not hardcode the label (e.g., \"<REDACTED>\"). Read it from the JSON file at runtime. Use a standard email regex (alphanumeric+symbols @ alphanumeric+symbols . alpha).\n*   **Sorting**: Sort the lines chronologically (ascending).\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be standard **UTF-8** with Unix line endings (`\\n`).\n\n#### 2. The Daily Summary (`/home/user/clean_data/daily_summary.csv`)\n\nThis file is ingested by a COBOL parser and is extremely brittle.\n\n*   **Format**: Comma-separated values (CSV).\n*   **Header**: `Date,Error_Count,Earliest_Error`\n*   **Data Rows**: Aggregated by date.\n    *   `Date`: Must be formatted as `DD-MMM-YYYY` in **UPPERCASE** (e.g., `01-JUL-2023`).\n    *   `Error_Count`: Total number of DataCleaner errors for that date.\n    *   `Earliest_Error`: The timestamp (`HH:MM:SS`) of the first error encountered on that date.\n*   **Encoding & Line Endings**: \n    *   The file must be encoded according to the `target_encoding` key in `settings.json` (e.g., ISO-8859-1).\n    *   The file must end with Windows-style CRLF line endings (`\\r\\n`), including the last line.\n\n#### 3. Verification Checksum (`/home/user/clean_data/checksum.md5`)\n\n*   Compute the MD5 checksum of the final `mainframe_errors.log` file.\n*   The file content should consist of the hash, followed by two spaces, followed by the filename `mainframe_errors.log`.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   **Tooling**: Use standard Linux shell utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `sort`, `jq`, `iconv`, `md5sum`, `date`, etc.). Do not use high-level scripting languages like Python, Ruby, or Perl for the main logic.\n*   **Precision**: The automated grader verifies binary exactness for the CSV encoding and line endings. Pay attention to the `settings.json` values.\n\n### Completion Criteria\n\n1.  `mainframe_errors.log` exists, includes only `prod-` logs, is filtered/redacted/sorted correctly, and matches the MD5 in the checksum file.\n2.  `daily_summary.csv` exists, uses the correct date format (UPPERCASE), correct encoding (from JSON), and CRLF line endings.\n3.  Redaction uses the specific label defined in the config file.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@8b14366c-41cf-4569-a1f7-b78a4076213f:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
