  "analysis": "I am starting in the /home/user directory as root. No prior work has been done for this task. I need to create a secure working directory, copy two baseline configuration files into it, create a backup archive of these files, harden them using provided policy files, and generate a detailed summary log of all operations.",
  "plan": "My first step is to create the working directory `/home/user/hardening_workshop` with strict permissions (0700). Then, I will copy the two baseline files (`sshd_config_baseline` and `sysctl_baseline.conf`) into this new directory, ensuring they also have strict permissions (0600). After copying, I will obtain the current UTC date and week number to correctly name the backup archive. I'll then create a gzipped tarball of the two copied files. Next, I will process the policy files to filter out comments and empty lines, and then append these active directives to copies of the baseline files to create the 'hardened' versions. Finally, I will generate a comprehensive log file at `/home/user/hardening_summary.log`, recording each operation with timestamps, SHA256 hashes, and other required details in UTC.",
