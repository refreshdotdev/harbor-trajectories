  "analysis": "The corrections have been applied. The archive is now named correctly (`baseline_backup_20260213_W07.tar.gz`). The baseline files and hardened files appear to have content (no longer 0 or 1 byte). However, the `hardening_summary.log` still contains empty HASH fields for all COPY, ARCHIVE, and HARDEN actions. This indicates that the variable substitution for SHA256 checksums is not working as intended in the shell execution environment; the output of `sha256sum` is being printed to the screen but not captured into the variables (`SUM1` through `SUM5`) for use in the `echo` commands for the log.",
  "plan": "Manually construct the final log entries. First, obtain the SHA256 hashes for all relevant files. Then, use these hashes to create the missing log entries. Since variables are not working for this purpose, direct string interpolation of the hashes into the `echo` commands will be attempted, or if that fails, a final `echo` command will be used to append complete, manually constructed log lines.",
