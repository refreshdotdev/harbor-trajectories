  "plan": "First, I will change the permissions of `/home/user/hardening_workshop` to 0700. Then, I will verify the directory exists and its permissions are correctly set. Next, I'll determine the current UTC date (YYYYMMDD) and the ISO-8601 week number (Www) to use for naming the backup archive. I will then copy `sshd_config_baseline` and `sysctl_baseline.conf` from their respective source directories into `/home/user/hardening_workshop`, setting their permissions to 0600 each. After the files are copied and their permissions are verified, I will create a compressed tarball named `baseline_backup_YYYYMMDD_Www.tar.gz` containing these two files, and set its permissions to 0600. Each of these steps (directory creation, file copies, archive creation) will be logged in `/home/user/hardening_summary.log` with the appropriate action tag, source/destination paths, UTC timestamp, and SHA256 checksum.",
