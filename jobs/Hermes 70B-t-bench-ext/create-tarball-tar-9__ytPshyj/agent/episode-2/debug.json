Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a Linux systems-engineer participating in a strict hardening workshop.\nYour job is to secure two baseline configuration files by archiving them and then applying specific security policies.\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Create a Secure Working Directory**\n    *   Create a directory: `/home/user/hardening_workshop`\n    *   **Constraint**: This directory must have strict permissions: **0700** (rwx------).\n\n2.  **Copy Baseline Files**\n    *   Copy the *exact* two baseline files listed below into `/home/user/hardening_workshop`, keeping their original filenames:\n        *   `/home/user/baseline_configs/ssh/sshd_config_baseline`\n        *   `/home/user/baseline_configs/sysctl/sysctl_baseline.conf`\n    *   **Constraint**: The copies must have strict permissions: **0600** (rw-------).\n\n3.  **Create a Backup Archive**\n    *   Inside `/home/user/hardening_workshop`, create **one** backup archive (a single, compressed **tar.gz**) containing *only* the two copied baseline files.\n    *   **Naming Convention**: `baseline_backup_YYYYMMDD_Www.tar.gz`\n        *   `YYYYMMDD`: Today\u2019s date in UTC.\n        *   `Www`: The ISO-8601 week number (01-53) of today\u2019s date (e.g., `W05`, `W42`).\n    *   **Constraint**: The archive file itself must have strict permissions: **0600**.\n\n4.  **Harden the Files via Policy**\n    *   You are provided with two raw policy files containing comments and blank lines:\n        *   `/home/user/security_policies/ssh_policy.txt`\n        *   `/home/user/security_policies/sysctl_policy.txt`\n    *   **Action**:\n        a.  Create `sshd_config_hardened`: A copy of `sshd_config_baseline` with the valid directives from `ssh_policy.txt` appended.\n        b.  Create `sysctl_hardened.conf`: A copy of `sysctl_baseline.conf` with the valid directives from `sysctl_policy.txt` appended.\n    *   **Parsing Rules**: You must **filter out** all empty lines and lines starting with `#` (comments) from the policy files before appending. Only active configuration lines should be appended.\n    *   **Constraint**: The hardened files must have strict permissions: **0600**.\n\n5.  **Generate a Verified Summary Log**\n    *   Create a log file: `/home/user/hardening_summary.log`\n    *   Log every operation that results in a new on-disk object (Directory, Copy, Archive, Hardened File).\n    *   **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC | ACTION=<tag> | SRC=<path> | DST=<path> | HASH=<sha256> | STATUS=OK`\n    *   **Fields**:\n        *   `<tag>`: MKDIR, COPY, ARCHIVE, HARDEN\n        *   `SRC`: Absolute source path. Use `-` (hyphen) for MKDIR and ARCHIVE.\n        *   `DST`: Absolute destination path.\n        *   `HASH`: The **SHA256 checksum** of the object at `DST`. Use `-` (hyphen) for MKDIR. For files/archives, it must be the full lowercase hex digest.\n    *   **Constraint**: Lines must be chronological. Use UTC time.\n\n**Automated Checker Validation:**\n*   Existence and permissions (0700 for dir, 0600 for files) of all artefacts.\n*   Correct naming of the tarball including the ISO week number.\n*   Correct filtering of policy files (no comments/blanks in hardened files).\n*   Log file format, including the correct SHA256 hashes of the created files.\n\n**Important:**\n*   Do not modify the original files in `baseline_configs` or `security_policies`.\n*   Timestamps and dates must be UTC.\n*   Only the `hardening_summary.log` is graded for the logging requirement.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@72ac3356-707f-4baa-96b4-3272f2ec3dd7:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
