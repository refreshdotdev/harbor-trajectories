Once I have these values, I will copy `sshd_config_baseline` from `/home/user/baseline_configs/ssh/` and `sysctl_baseline.conf` from `/home/user/baseline_configs/sysctl/` into `/home/user/hardening_workshop`. Immediately after each copy, I will set the permissions of the copied file to 0600. Each file copy operation will be logged in `/home/user/hardening_summary.log` with a 'COPY' action, source path, destination path, UTC timestamp, and the SHA256 hash of the copied file.",
