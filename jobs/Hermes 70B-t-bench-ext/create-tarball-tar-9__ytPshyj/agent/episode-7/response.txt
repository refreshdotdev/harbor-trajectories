Then, I will process the raw `ssh_policy.txt` file, located at `/home/user/security_policies/ssh_policy.txt`. I will use `grep` to filter out lines starting with `#` and `grep` again to filter out empty lines. The resulting active directives will be appended to `sshd_config_hardened`. Finally, I will set the permissions of `sshd_config_hardened` to 0600 and calculate its SHA256 checksum. This 'HARDEN' action will be logged.",
