This suggests that either `ssh_policy.txt` contained only comments and empty lines after filtering, or the source `sshd_config_baseline` was empty and no new directives were appended. The next step is to perform the same hardening process for the sysctl configuration file.",
  "plan": "I will copy `sysctl_baseline.conf` to `sysctl_hardened.conf` within `/home/user/hardening_workshop`. Then, I will process the raw `sysctl_policy.txt` file, located at `/home/user/security_policies/sysctl_policy.txt`. I will filter out lines starting with `#` and empty lines. The resulting active directives will be appended to `sysctl_hardened.conf`. Finally, I will set the permissions of `sysctl_hardened.conf` to 0600 and calculate its SHA256 checksum. This 'HARDEN' action will be logged.",
