  "analysis": "The current terminal state shows a fresh shell in the root user's home directory. No prior backup-related work has been done yet. The environment variables BACKUP_DEST and LOG_FILE are mentioned as being set, but their actual values are unknown. The mission requires creating a backup script that creates a tar.gz archive from /home/user/data with specific filtering and normalization rules, generates a SHA-256 checksum, and logs the operation with a header requirement.",
  "plan": "First, I will examine the current environment variables to understand the configured paths. Then, I will verify the existence of the source data directory and create the necessary backup destination and log directories if they don't exist. After that, I will implement the backup creation process with proper filtering (excluding .tmp files and broken symlinks), normalization (setting ownership to root:root and removing others' permissions), checksum generation, and logging with the required header format.",
