The filesystem contains a data directory `/home/user/data` with various project files and reports.\n2. The environment defines two variables (already set in the container):\n   \u2022 `BACKUP_DEST`: The directory where archives and checksums must be stored.\n   \u2022 `LOG_FILE`: The full path to the log file.\n\nMission\n-------\n1. **Configuration & Setup**\n   \u2022 Your script must read the destination directory from the `BACKUP_DEST` environment variable. (If unset, default to `/home/user/archives`).\n   \u2022 Your script must read the log file path from the `LOG_FILE` environment variable. (If unset, default to `/home/user/backup_logs/backup.log`).\n   \u2022 Ensure these directories exist before writing to them.\n\n2. **Archive Creation with Filtering & Normalization**\n   \u2022 Create a compressed **tar.gz** archive of the contents of `/home/user/data/`.\n   \u2022 **Exclusions**: You must EXCLUDE any files ending in `.tmp` and any symbolic links that are broken (point to non-existent targets).\n   \u2022 **Normalization**: Inside the archive, to satisfy compliance rules:\n     - All entries (files and directories) must be owned by **root** (UID 0) and group **root** (GID 0).\n     - All entries must have **NO permissions for 'others'** (e.g., `chmod o-rwx`). Standard permissions for owner/group are fine (e.g., 0640 or 0750).\n   \u2022 The archive name must be: `daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` (stored in `BACKUP_DEST`).\n\n3. **Checksum**\n   \u2022 Produce a SHA-256 checksum file in `BACKUP_DEST` named `daily_YYYYMMDD.sha256`.\n   \u2022 Content format: `SHA256 (daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz) = <64-hex-digit-digest>`\n\n4. **Logging with Header**\n   \u2022 Append a line to `LOG_FILE`.\n   \u2022 **Header Requirement**: If the log file is being created for the first time (it does not exist yet), the **first line** of the file must be exactly:\n     `TIMESTAMP | ARCHIVE | STATUS`\n   \u2022 The log entry for the run must follow this format:\n     `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz - OK`\n\n5. **Rotation**\n   \u2022 If the archive or checksum file already exists in `BACKUP_DEST`, rename the existing one to append `.bak-UNIXTIMESTAMP` before creating the new one.\n\nExpected final state\n--------------------\n1. The `daily_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` exists in the configured `BACKUP_DEST`.\n2. The archive contains all files from `/home/user/data` EXCEPT `.tmp` files and broken symlinks. Directory entries should not be explicitly included as members, only the files themselves.\n3. The archive members have UID 0, GID 0, and no permissions for 'others'.\n4. The checksum file exists and is valid.\n5. The `LOG_FILE` exists, starts with the header (if it was new), and contains the success log line.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b1a5b1bc-02c8-4477-9fc3-ddfebb3eb6de:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
