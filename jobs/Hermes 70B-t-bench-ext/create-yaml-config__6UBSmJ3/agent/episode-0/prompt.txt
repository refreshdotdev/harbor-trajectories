You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are an edge-computing engineer deploying updated code to a fleet of IoT devices.
    In this sandbox one device is represented by the local directory  
    /home/user/iot_device/edge_app/  

    A freshly-built release is waiting in  
    /home/user/edge_source/  

    Your goal is to **synchronise** the two trees and apply device-specific configurations.

    **Requirements:**

    1. **Synchronisation**:
       Synchronise `/home/user/edge_source/` to `/home/user/iot_device/edge_app/`.
       - Copy new or modified files.
       - Remove any files in the destination that do not exist in the source.
       - **EXCEPTION**: Do **not** copy any files ending in `.log` or `.tmp` from the source. These are build artifacts and must not exist on the device.

    2. **Configuration Interpolation**:
       The source `config.yaml` contains the placeholder `{{SERIAL_NUMBER}}`.
       - You must replace this string in the destination file with the actual device serial number found in `/etc/iot_serial`.
       - Ensure you trim any surrounding whitespace from the serial number source.
       - The final `config.yaml` in the destination must contain `setting: prod` and the correct `serial: ...` line.

    3. **Permissions & Security**:
       - All Python scripts (`.py`) in the destination must be executable by everyone (mode `755` / `rwxr-xr-x`).
       - The `config.yaml` file in the destination contains secrets; it must be read-only for the owner and inaccessible to others (mode `400` / `r--------`).

    4. **Manifest Generation**:
       - Create a file `/home/user/iot_device/edge_app/manifest.txt`.
       - This file must contain the SHA-256 checksums of all files in the destination directory (excluding `manifest.txt` itself).
       - Format: `HASH  filename` (two spaces between hash and filename), one per line.
       - The list must be sorted alphabetically by filename.

    5. **Logging**:
       - Create the directory `/home/user/deployment_logs/` (if missing).
       - Create `/home/user/deployment_logs/sync_2024.log` with **exactly** these three lines (terminated by UNIX newlines):
         ```text
         SYNC COMPLETE
         SOURCE: /home/user/edge_source/
         DESTINATION: /home/user/iot_device/edge_app/
         ```

    **Notes & Constraints**:
    - Do not modify the paths shown above.
    - You do *not* have SSH access; treat the “remote” device as the local directory given.
    - Do not run commands with sudo. Everything must be achievable as the normal user.
    - When you are finished, the grader will verify all conditions exactly.
