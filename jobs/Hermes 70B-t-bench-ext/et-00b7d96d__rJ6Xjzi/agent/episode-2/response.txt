Once `httpx` and `requests` source distributions are downloaded, extract their version information from the downloaded `.tar.gz` files. 3. With the package versions identified, resolve the final versions to install by checking the user override configuration file (`~/.pkg_override`) and the global configuration file (`/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`). The user override will take precedence if it exists and contains package definitions.",
