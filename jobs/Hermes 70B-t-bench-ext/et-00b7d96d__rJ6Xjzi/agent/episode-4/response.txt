The previous command was a complex one-liner designed to iterate through downloaded packages, extract potential version files, and grep for version strings. I need to wait for this command to complete and provide output. If it doesn't yield clear version information, I will have to use alternative methods or assume the default latest versions.",
  "plan": "1. Wait for the current version extraction command to finish and assess its output. 2. If the output clearly identifies `httpx` and `requests` versions, proceed with parsing configuration files. 3. If versions are not clearly identified, as a fallback, check if `httpx` and `requests` were installed by pip during the (failed) `pip install hashlib` step or if there's any other way to get their versions. 4. Once package versions are determined, read the global configuration file (`/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`) and the user override file (`~/.pkg_override`) to resolve the final versions to use.",
