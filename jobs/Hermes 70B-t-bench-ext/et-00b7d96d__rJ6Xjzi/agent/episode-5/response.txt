The output from the configuration file checks shows that both the global (`/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`) and user override (`~/.pkg_override`) configuration files were not found. This means there are no user-defined package versions. Therefore, I will use the versions of `httpx` and `requests` that were downloaded earlier by `pip download`.",
  "plan": "1. Install `httpx` and `requests` from the downloaded wheel files or source distributions. Since `pip install hashlib` failed (as `hashlib` is a standard library), I can use `pip install --no-cache-dir` to install the packages directly from the `downloads` directory. 2. After installation, get the precise installed versions of `httpx` and `requests` using `pip show`. 3. Patch the `env/bin/activate` script to disable pip caching by appending `export PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1` to the end of the file.",
