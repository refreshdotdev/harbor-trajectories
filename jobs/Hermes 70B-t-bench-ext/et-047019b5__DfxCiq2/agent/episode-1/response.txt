I have successfully navigated to `/home/user`, created the `forensics` subdirectory, navigated into it, and created a Python virtual environment named `clean_env`. I have also appended the line to set the custom prompt `(AUDIT_SAFE)` to the environment's activation script. The next step is to activate this newly created virtual environment and verify that the custom prompt is active.",

This will activate the custom prompt, isolate my Python environment from the system's potentially compromised one, and allow me to install Python packages specifically for this audit task. I expect the command prompt to change to `(AUDIT_SAFE)` after activation.",
