  "analysis": "The attempt to install the `wheel` package using `pip install wheel` has encountered network connectivity issues, specifically 'No address associated with hostname' when trying to access PyPI. The `pip freeze` command was then executed, which should list all currently installed packages in the virtual environment. This list is important for later comparison and understanding the baseline state. Since `wheel` installation failed, I need to address this. For now, I will proceed to fetch the banlist and begin parsing it, as this is a crucial prerequisite for filtering packages later. I will also need to find a way to install `wheel` if it's not already present or if the network issue is persistent.",
  "plan": "My immediate priority is to obtain and parse the `legacy_banlist.txt` file. I will first check if `curl` is available for downloading the file. If not, I'll proceed with `wget`. The banlist is located at `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt`. I need to handle its specific characteristics: ISO-8859-1 encoding, potential Windows CRLF line endings, and comments/empty lines that must be ignored. I will create a temporary script to process this file into a usable format (a list of banned package names). After processing, I'll check if `wheel` is already in the current `pip freeze` output and attempt installation again, possibly using a local copy if network issues persist.",
