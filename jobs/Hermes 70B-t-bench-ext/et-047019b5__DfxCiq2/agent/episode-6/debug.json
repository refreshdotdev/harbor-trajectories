Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Security Audit & Remediation Task: Incident 714-B\n\nYou are acting as a forensic DevSecOps engineer responding to a potential supply chain compromise. We need to establish a clean, audited Python environment to run forensic tools, but the workstation you are on is partially compromised and has strict legacy compliance requirements.\n\n## Context & Environmental Constraints\n\nThe previous engineer left the workstation in a bad state. The global `pip` configuration is corrupted (do not attempt to fix the global file; bypass it). Furthermore, you are working under **Policy 714-B**, which dictates how software inventories are reported. This policy was written for integration with a legacy mainframe, which imposes specific encoding and formatting constraints on your output.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYour goal is to create a specific virtual environment and generate a cryptographically signed manifest of its contents. This manifest must be machine-readable by the legacy auditing system.\n\n### 1. Environment Setup\n\nEstablish a new virtual environment. The directory structure is strict:\n\n*   Root: `/home/user/forensics`\n*   Venv location: `/home/user/forensics/clean_env`\n\n**Critical:** To prevent confusion with the compromised system shell, the virtual environment\u2019s activation script must set the prompt to exactly `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The default prompt is not acceptable.\n\n### 2. Package Inventory & Filtering\n\nOnce the environment is created, you must generate a snapshot of installed packages (`pip freeze`). However, you must filter this list against the **Legacy Banlist**.\n\n*   The banlist is located at `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt`.\n*   **Warning:** This file is generated by a 1990s mainframe. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**, not UTF-8. It contains comments (lines starting with `#`) and empty lines, which must be ignored. It may also contain Windows-style line endings (CRLF).\n*   Any package listed in the banlist (case-insensitive match) must be **excluded** from your final inventory. \n*   Ensure `wheel` is installed in your venv before freezing, as the auditing tools require it.\n\n### 3. Manifest Generation (The \"Tricky\" Part)\n\nYou must generate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.json`. \n\nUnlike standard `pip freeze` output, this file must adhere to the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scan_timestamp\": \"<UTC_ISO8601>\",\n  \"environment_inode\": <integer>,\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"<package_name>\",\n      \"version\": \"<package_version>\"\n    }\n    // ... more packages sorted alphabetically by name\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Schema Details:**\n*   `scan_timestamp`: Must be the current time in UTC, formatted strictly as ISO 8601 (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).\n*   `environment_inode`: The filesystem inode number of the `clean_env` directory. The legacy system uses this to verify the directory hasn't been swapped out.\n*   `packages`: A list of objects. Each object has `name` and `version`. The list must be sorted alphabetically by package name.\n*   **Formatting:** The JSON file must be **minified**. No newlines, no spaces between keys/values. A single line of text.\n\n### 4. Cryptographic Signing\n\nFinally, generate a signature for the manifest.\n\n*   Calculate the **SHA-512** (not 256) hash of the `audit_manifest.json` file.\n*   Write this hash to `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.sig`.\n*   The file must contain **only** the hex digest string (128 characters), with no trailing newline and no filename appended.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWhen complete, `/home/user/forensics/` should contain:\n1.  `clean_env/` (The venv with custom prompt)\n2.  `audit_manifest.json` (Minified, filtered JSON inventory with metadata)\n3.  `audit_manifest.sig` (SHA-512 hash of the JSON)\n\nEnsure you handle the Latin-1 encoding of the banlist correctly, or your filter will fail silently, causing the audit to reject your submission.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@be43a4ce-7819-4478-a685-e07ad41d9d12:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Security Audit & Remediation Task: Incident 714-B\n\nYou are acting as a forensic DevSecOps engineer responding to a potential supply chain compromise. We need to establish a clean, audited Python environment to run forensic tools, but the workstation you are on is partially compromised and has strict legacy compliance requirements.\n\n## Context & Environmental Constraints\n\nThe previous engineer left the workstation in a bad state. The global `pip` configuration is corrupted (do not attempt to fix the global file; bypass it). Furthermore, you are working under **Policy 714-B**, which dictates how software inventories are reported. This policy was written for integration with a legacy mainframe, which imposes specific encoding and formatting constraints on your output.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYour goal is to create a specific virtual environment and generate a cryptographically signed manifest of its contents. This manifest must be machine-readable by the legacy auditing system.\n\n### 1. Environment Setup\n\nEstablish a new virtual environment. The directory structure is strict:\n\n*   Root: `/home/user/forensics`\n*   Venv location: `/home/user/forensics/clean_env`\n\n**Critical:** To prevent confusion with the compromised system shell, the virtual environment\u2019s activation script must set the prompt to exactly `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The default prompt is not acceptable.\n\n### 2. Package Inventory & Filtering\n\nOnce the environment is created, you must generate a snapshot of installed packages (`pip freeze`). However, you must filter this list against the **Legacy Banlist**.\n\n*   The banlist is located at `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt`.\n*   **Warning:** This file is generated by a 1990s mainframe. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**, not UTF-8. It contains comments (lines starting with `#`) and empty lines, which must be ignored. It may also contain Windows-style line endings (CRLF).\n*   Any package listed in the banlist (case-insensitive match) must be **excluded** from your final inventory. \n*   Ensure `wheel` is installed in your venv before freezing, as the auditing tools require it.\n\n### 3. Manifest Generation (The \"Tricky\" Part)\n\nYou must generate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.json`. \n\nUnlike standard `pip freeze` output, this file must adhere to the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scan_timestamp\": \"<UTC_ISO8601>\",\n  \"environment_inode\": <integer>,\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"<package_name>\",\n      \"version\": \"<package_version>\"\n    }\n    // ... more packages sorted alphabetically by name\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Schema Details:**\n*   `scan_timestamp`: Must be the current time in UTC, formatted strictly as ISO 8601 (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).\n*   `environment_inode`: The filesystem inode number of the `clean_env` directory. The legacy system uses this to verify the directory hasn't been swapped out.\n*   `packages`: A list of objects. Each object has `name` and `version`. The list must be sorted alphabetically by package name.\n*   **Formatting:** The JSON file must be **minified**. No newlines, no spaces between keys/values. A single line of text.\n\n### 4. Cryptographic Signing\n\nFinally, generate a signature for the manifest.\n\n*   Calculate the **SHA-512** (not 256) hash of the `audit_manifest.json` file.\n*   Write this hash to `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.sig`.\n*   The file must contain **only** the hex digest string (128 characters), with no trailing newline and no filename appended.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWhen complete, `/home/user/forensics/` should contain:\n1.  `clean_env/` (The venv with custom prompt)\n2.  `audit_manifest.json` (Minified, filtered JSON inventory with metadata)\n3.  `audit_manifest.sig` (SHA-512 hash of the JSON)\n\nEnsure you handle the Latin-1 encoding of the banlist correctly, or your filter will fail silently, causing the audit to reject your submission.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@be43a4ce-7819-4478-a685-e07ad41d9d12:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We need to establish a clean, audited Python environment to run forensic tools, but the workstation you are on is partially compromised and has strict legacy compliance requirements.\n\n## Context & Environmental Constraints\n\nThe previous engineer left the workstation in a bad state. The global `pip` configuration is corrupted (do not attempt to fix the global file; bypass it). Furthermore, you are working under **Policy 714-B**, which dictates how software inventories are reported. This policy was written for integration with a legacy mainframe, which imposes specific encoding and formatting constraints on your output.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYour goal is to create a specific virtual environment and generate a cryptographically signed manifest of its contents. This manifest must be machine-readable by the legacy auditing system.\n\n### 1. Environment Setup\n\nEstablish a new virtual environment. The directory structure is strict:\n\n*   Root: `/home/user/forensics`\n*   Venv location: `/home/user/forensics/clean_env`\n\n**Critical:** To prevent confusion with the compromised system shell, the virtual environment\u2019s activation script must set the prompt to exactly `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The default prompt is not acceptable.\n\n### 2. Package Inventory & Filtering\n\nOnce the environment is created, you must generate a snapshot of installed packages (`pip freeze`). However, you must filter this list against the **Legacy Banlist**.\n\n*   The banlist is located at `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt`.\n*   **Warning:** This file is generated by a 1990s mainframe. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**, not UTF-8. It contains comments (lines starting with `#`) and empty lines, which must be ignored. It may also contain Windows-style line endings (CRLF).\n*   Any package listed in the banlist (case-insensitive match) must be **excluded** from your final inventory. \n*   Ensure `wheel` is installed in your venv before freezing, as the auditing tools require it.\n\n### 3. Manifest Generation (The \"Tricky\" Part)\n\nYou must generate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.json`. \n\nUnlike standard `pip freeze` output, this file must adhere to the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scan_timestamp\": \"<UTC_ISO8601>\",\n  \"environment_inode\": <integer>,\n  \"packages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"<package_name>\",\n      \"version\": \"<package_version>\"\n    }\n    // ... more packages sorted alphabetically by name\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Schema Details:**\n*   `scan_timestamp`: Must be the current time in UTC, formatted strictly as ISO 8601 (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).\n*   `environment_inode`: The filesystem inode number of the `clean_env` directory. The legacy system uses this to verify the directory hasn't been swapped out.\n*   `packages`: A list of objects. Each object has `name` and `version`. The list must be sorted alphabetically by package name.\n*   **Formatting:** The JSON file must be **minified**. No newlines, no spaces between keys/values. A single line of text.\n\n### 4. Cryptographic Signing\n\nFinally, generate a signature for the manifest.\n\n*   Calculate the **SHA-512** (not 256) hash of the `audit_manifest.json` file.\n*   Write this hash to `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.sig`.\n*   The file must contain **only** the hex digest string (128 characters), with no trailing newline and no filename appended.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWhen complete, `/home/user/forensics/` should contain:\n1.  `clean_env/` (The venv with custom prompt)\n2.  `audit_manifest.json` (Minified, filtered JSON inventory with metadata)\n3.  `audit_manifest.sig` (SHA-512 hash of the JSON)\n\nEnsure you handle the Latin-1 encoding of the banlist correctly, or your filter will fail silently, causing the audit to reject your submission.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@be43a4ce-7819-4478-a685-e07ad41d9d12:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
