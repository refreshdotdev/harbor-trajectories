You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Security Audit & Remediation Task: Incident 714-B

You are acting as a forensic DevSecOps engineer responding to a potential supply chain compromise. We need to establish a clean, audited Python environment to run forensic tools, but the workstation you are on is partially compromised and has strict legacy compliance requirements.

## Context & Environmental Constraints

The previous engineer left the workstation in a bad state. The global `pip` configuration is corrupted (do not attempt to fix the global file; bypass it). Furthermore, you are working under **Policy 714-B**, which dictates how software inventories are reported. This policy was written for integration with a legacy mainframe, which imposes specific encoding and formatting constraints on your output.

## Objectives

Your goal is to create a specific virtual environment and generate a cryptographically signed manifest of its contents. This manifest must be machine-readable by the legacy auditing system.

### 1. Environment Setup

Establish a new virtual environment. The directory structure is strict:

*   Root: `/home/user/forensics`
*   Venv location: `/home/user/forensics/clean_env`

**Critical:** To prevent confusion with the compromised system shell, the virtual environment’s activation script must set the prompt to exactly `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The default prompt is not acceptable.

### 2. Package Inventory & Filtering

Once the environment is created, you must generate a snapshot of installed packages (`pip freeze`). However, you must filter this list against the **Legacy Banlist**.

*   The banlist is located at `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt`.
*   **Warning:** This file is generated by a 1990s mainframe. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**, not UTF-8. It contains comments (lines starting with `#`) and empty lines, which must be ignored. It may also contain Windows-style line endings (CRLF).
*   Any package listed in the banlist (case-insensitive match) must be **excluded** from your final inventory. 
*   Ensure `wheel` is installed in your venv before freezing, as the auditing tools require it.

### 3. Manifest Generation (The "Tricky" Part)

You must generate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.json`. 

Unlike standard `pip freeze` output, this file must adhere to the following schema:

```json
{
  "scan_timestamp": "<UTC_ISO8601>",
  "environment_inode": <integer>,
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "<package_name>",
      "version": "<package_version>"
    }
    // ... more packages sorted alphabetically by name
  ]
}
```

**Schema Details:**
*   `scan_timestamp`: Must be the current time in UTC, formatted strictly as ISO 8601 (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).
*   `environment_inode`: The filesystem inode number of the `clean_env` directory. The legacy system uses this to verify the directory hasn't been swapped out.
*   `packages`: A list of objects. Each object has `name` and `version`. The list must be sorted alphabetically by package name.
*   **Formatting:** The JSON file must be **minified**. No newlines, no spaces between keys/values. A single line of text.

### 4. Cryptographic Signing

Finally, generate a signature for the manifest.

*   Calculate the **SHA-512** (not 256) hash of the `audit_manifest.json` file.
*   Write this hash to `/home/user/forensics/audit_manifest.sig`.
*   The file must contain **only** the hex digest string (128 characters), with no trailing newline and no filename appended.

## Deliverables

When complete, `/home/user/forensics/` should contain:
1.  `clean_env/` (The venv with custom prompt)
2.  `audit_manifest.json` (Minified, filtered JSON inventory with metadata)
3.  `audit_manifest.sig` (SHA-512 hash of the JSON)

Ensure you handle the Latin-1 encoding of the banlist correctly, or your filter will fail silently, causing the audit to reject your submission.
