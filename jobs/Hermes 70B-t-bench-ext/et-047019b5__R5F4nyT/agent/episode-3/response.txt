  "analysis": "I have successfully activated the `clean_env` virtual environment; the prompt is correctly set to `(AUDIT_SAFE)`. The `pip install wheel` command is attempting to download from an invalid PyPI index. This suggests that the environment may not have proper network access or is configured to use a non-functional package index. I need to check the pip configuration and ensure that the banlist file exists and is accessible.",
  "plan": "I will first verify the existence and permissions of the `/var/lib/secops/legacy_banlist.txt` file using `ls` and `cat`. Then, I will examine the pip configuration to understand why it's trying to use `invalid.pypi.org`. Since we are working under strict compliance requirements, I must ensure all operations adhere to Policy 714-B.",
