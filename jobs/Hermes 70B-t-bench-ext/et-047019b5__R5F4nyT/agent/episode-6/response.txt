I can see from the terminal that the banlist file exists, but the pip installation is failing due to a misconfigured index URL pointing to `https://invalid.pypi.org/simple`. This means I won't be able to install `wheel` from PyPI. However, I can still run the manifest script to generate the inventory of the minimal packages that come with a new virtual environment.",
  "plan": "I will execute the `generate_manifest.py` script using the virtual environment's Python interpreter. The script will generate the JSON manifest with the required metadata (timestamp, inode, and filtered packages). After the manifest is created, I will generate its SHA-512 hash and write it to the signature file.",
