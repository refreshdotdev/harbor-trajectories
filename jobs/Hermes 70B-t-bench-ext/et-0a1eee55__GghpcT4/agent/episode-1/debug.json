The data is messy and contains outliers, testing artifacts, and records outside the relevant time window.\n\nAll files exist in \u201c/home/user/data\u201d.\n\n**Source Files:**\n1.  /home/user/data/resource_cpu.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,cpu_percent)\n2.  /home/user/data/resource_memory.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,mem_mb)\n3.  /home/user/data/resource_disk.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,disk_gb)\n\n**Task Overview:**\nProcess these files to generate a JSON summary and a high-load report CSV in \u201c/home/user/output\u201d. You must apply strict filtering rules to clean the data before aggregation.\n\n**1. Data Filtering Rules**\nBefore calculating any statistics, you must filter the raw rows. A row is **VALID** only if it meets **ALL** of the following criteria:\n*   **Time Window:** The timestamp is strictly between **00:30:00 UTC** and **01:30:00 UTC** (inclusive) on any date.\n*   **Hostname:** The hostname does **not** contain the substring \u201ccanary\u201d (case-insensitive).\n*   **Value Constraints:**\n    *   `cpu_percent` must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive).\n    *   `mem_mb` must be strictly greater than 0.\n    *   `disk_gb` must be strictly greater than 0.\n\nRows failing any of these checks must be skipped.\n\n**2. Statistics Calculation**\nFor every unique hostname found in the valid data:\n*   Calculate the **Arithmetic Mean (Average)** for each metric.\n*   Calculate the **Maximum** value for each metric.\n*   If a host has valid data for one metric but no valid data for another, treat the missing metric as 0 for that host.\n\n**3. JSON Output**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/summary.json\u201d.\nStructure:\n```json\n{\n  \"generated_at\": \"<RFC-3339 UTC timestamp>\",\n  \"global_valid_rows\": <integer total count of all valid rows consumed across all 3 files>,\n  \"hosts\": {\n    \"<hostname>\": {\n      \"cpu_avg\": <float>,\n      \"cpu_max\": <float>,\n      \"mem_avg_mb\": <float>,\n      \"mem_max_mb\": <float>,\n      \"disk_avg_gb\": <float>,\n      \"disk_max_gb\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n*   Host objects must be sorted alphabetically by hostname.\n*   Numeric values should be standard JSON numbers.\n\n**4. High Load CSV Report**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/high_load_hosts.csv\u201d containing hosts that satisfy **at least one** of these conditions (based on calculated averages):\n*   cpu_avg > 60\n*   mem_avg_mb > 3000\n*   disk_avg_gb > 250\n\n**Format Requirements:**\n*   **Delimiter:** Use a pipe character `|` instead of a comma.\n*   **Precision:** All numeric values must be formatted to **exactly 3 decimal places**.\n*   **Header:** `hostname|cpu_avg|mem_avg_mb|disk_avg_gb`\n*   **Sort:** Alphabetical by hostname.\n\nExample row:\n`db-1|85.000|4000.000|300.000`\n\n**5. Process Log**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/process.log\u201d.\nFormat: `<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> - <message>`\n\nRequired events (exact message format required):\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_cpu.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_memory.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_disk.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `wrote summary.json`\n*   `wrote high_load_hosts.csv`\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   Do not modify original files.\n*   Output directory must be created if it doesn't exist.\n*   You do not have root access.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@29ce0424-abc0-456c-a6b9-a0acda54f5ac:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a capacity-planning analyst who has just received three raw metric exports (CPU, memory, disk). The data is messy and contains outliers, testing artifacts, and records outside the relevant time window.\n\nAll files exist in \u201c/home/user/data\u201d.\n\n**Source Files:**\n1.  /home/user/data/resource_cpu.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,cpu_percent)\n2.  /home/user/data/resource_memory.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,mem_mb)\n3.  /home/user/data/resource_disk.csv (Columns: timestamp,hostname,disk_gb)\n\n**Task Overview:**\nProcess these files to generate a JSON summary and a high-load report CSV in \u201c/home/user/output\u201d. You must apply strict filtering rules to clean the data before aggregation.\n\n**1. Data Filtering Rules**\nBefore calculating any statistics, you must filter the raw rows. A row is **VALID** only if it meets **ALL** of the following criteria:\n*   **Time Window:** The timestamp is strictly between **00:30:00 UTC** and **01:30:00 UTC** (inclusive) on any date.\n*   **Hostname:** The hostname does **not** contain the substring \u201ccanary\u201d (case-insensitive).\n*   **Value Constraints:**\n    *   `cpu_percent` must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive).\n    *   `mem_mb` must be strictly greater than 0.\n    *   `disk_gb` must be strictly greater than 0.\n\nRows failing any of these checks must be skipped.\n\n**2. Statistics Calculation**\nFor every unique hostname found in the valid data:\n*   Calculate the **Arithmetic Mean (Average)** for each metric.\n*   Calculate the **Maximum** value for each metric.\n*   If a host has valid data for one metric but no valid data for another, treat the missing metric as 0 for that host.\n\n**3. JSON Output**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/summary.json\u201d.\nStructure:\n```json\n{\n  \"generated_at\": \"<RFC-3339 UTC timestamp>\",\n  \"global_valid_rows\": <integer total count of all valid rows consumed across all 3 files>,\n  \"hosts\": {\n    \"<hostname>\": {\n      \"cpu_avg\": <float>,\n      \"cpu_max\": <float>,\n      \"mem_avg_mb\": <float>,\n      \"mem_max_mb\": <float>,\n      \"disk_avg_gb\": <float>,\n      \"disk_max_gb\": <float>\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n*   Host objects must be sorted alphabetically by hostname.\n*   Numeric values should be standard JSON numbers.\n\n**4. High Load CSV Report**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/high_load_hosts.csv\u201d containing hosts that satisfy **at least one** of these conditions (based on calculated averages):\n*   cpu_avg > 60\n*   mem_avg_mb > 3000\n*   disk_avg_gb > 250\n\n**Format Requirements:**\n*   **Delimiter:** Use a pipe character `|` instead of a comma.\n*   **Precision:** All numeric values must be formatted to **exactly 3 decimal places**.\n*   **Header:** `hostname|cpu_avg|mem_avg_mb|disk_avg_gb`\n*   **Sort:** Alphabetical by hostname.\n\nExample row:\n`db-1|85.000|4000.000|300.000`\n\n**5. Process Log**\nCreate \u201c/home/user/output/process.log\u201d.\nFormat: `<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> - <message>`\n\nRequired events (exact message format required):\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_cpu.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_memory.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `loaded /home/user/data/resource_disk.csv (kept: <N>, skipped: <M>)`\n*   `wrote summary.json`\n*   `wrote high_load_hosts.csv`\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   Do not modify original files.\n*   Output directory must be created if it doesn't exist.\n*   You do not have root access.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@29ce0424-abc0-456c-a6b9-a0acda54f5ac:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
