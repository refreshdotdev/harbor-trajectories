  "analysis": "I am starting in the `/home/user` directory as the root user. No prior work appears to have been done for this legacy microservice compliance task. I need to create the webroot directory with specific permissions, process a template file with UTF-8 BOM removal, string substitution, and character encoding conversion to ISO-8859-1, start a Python HTTP server, and generate an audit manifest file.",
  "plan": "First, I'll create the necessary directory structure including the webroot and output directories. Then I'll set the SGID bit and permissions on the webroot directory. After that, I'll process the template file: remove the BOM, perform substitution, convert encoding to ISO-8859-1, and save it. Next, I'll start the Python HTTP server in the background. Finally, I'll generate the audit manifest file with the MD5 hash and Content-Length header information.",
