1. Create the webroot directory with the required permissions (2750 with SGID bit)
2. Process the banner.tpl template by:
   a. Reading the file
   b. Stripping the BOM
   c. Substituting {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}} with the environment variable value (defaulting to 'Unknown Entity' if unset)
   d. Converting from UTF-8 with BOM to ISO-8859-1 encoding
3. Save the processed content to index.html in the webroot directory
4. Start a Python HTTP server on port 9000 serving from the webroot directory
5. Generate the audit manifest with:
   a. MD5 checksum of the ISO-8859-1 encoded index.html file
   b. Content-Length header value from the HTTP server response
The commands will be executed in batches to ensure proper execution flow and verification at each step.",
