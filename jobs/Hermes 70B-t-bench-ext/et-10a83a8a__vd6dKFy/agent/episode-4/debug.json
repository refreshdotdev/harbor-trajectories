On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Legacy Microservice Compliance Task\n\n## Context\nYou are assisting the \"Legacy Integration Team\" in validating a container environment for an older banking application. This system interacts with mainframes that strictly enforce specific character encodings and filesystem permissions. Unlike modern cloud-native apps, this service is extremely sensitive to byte-level details.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYour goal is to provision the web root, process a compliance template, and verify the service output. Please read the following requirements carefully, as the automated verification suite checks for byte-for-byte exactness.\n\n### 1. Filesystem Configuration\n\nThe service requires a specific directory structure to host its static assets. \n\n*   **Location:** You must create the directory `/home/user/microservices/webroot`.\n*   **Permissions:** Security policy mandates that this directory must have the **Set-Group-ID (SGID)** bit set, along with standard read/execute for the group. The exact numeric mode should be `2750` (rwxr-s---).\n\n### 2. Content Generation (The \"Template\" Pipeline)\n\nYou must not create the `index.html` file from scratch. Instead, you must process a raw template located at `/var/lib/compliance/templates/banner.tpl`.\n\n**Processing Rules:**\n\n1.  **Source:** Read the `banner.tpl` file. Be aware that this file was authored on a Windows workstation; it is encoded in **UTF-8** and includes a **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** at the very beginning.\n2.  **Sanitization:** You must strip the BOM before processing.\n3.  **Substitution:** The template contains the placeholder string `{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}`. Replace this string with the value of the environment variable `TARGET_AUDIENCE`. If the variable is unset, default to `Unknown Entity`.\n4.  **Encoding Conversion:** The mainframe scrapers that will read this page *cannot* handle UTF-8. You must save the final `index.html` encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**.\n    *   *Note:* The template contains a Copyright symbol (\u00a9). In the source UTF-8 file, this is two bytes (`0xC2 0xA9`). In your output `index.html`, it must be the single byte `0xA9` defined by ISO-8859-1.\n5.  **Destination:** Save the processed file to `/home/user/microservices/webroot/index.html`.\n\n### 3. Service Execution\n\nStart a Python HTTP server to serve the content.\n\n*   **Port:** The server must listen on port **9000**.\n*   **Root:** It must serve files from `/home/user/microservices/webroot`.\n*   **Persistence:** The server must run in the background.\n\n### 4. Verification and Manifest Generation\n\nOnce the server is running, you must verify the deployment and generate a specific manifest file expected by the audit subsystem.\n\nCreate a file at `/home/user/output/audit_manifest.txt`. This file must contain exactly two lines:\n\n**Line 1:** The MD5 checksum of the `index.html` file, followed by two spaces, followed by the **relative path** of the file from the `/home/user` directory.\n*   *Format:* `<md5_hash>  microservices/webroot/index.html`\n\n**Line 2:** The exact value of the `Content-Length` HTTP header returned by the server when requesting `http://localhost:9000/index.html`.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n*   Ensure there is no trailing whitespace on any line.\n*   The manifest file itself should be UTF-8 encoded.\n*   Double-check that your MD5 hash matches the *ISO-8859-1* bytes of the file on disk, not the UTF-8 representation.\n\n## Summary of Artifacts\n\nUpon completion, the following must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/microservices/webroot/` (Mode 2750)\n2.  `/home/user/microservices/webroot/index.html` (ISO-8859-1 encoded, no BOM)\n3.  `/home/user/output/audit_manifest.txt` (Two specific lines)\n4.  A running Python HTTP process on port 9000.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@fa6955c0-6438-458e-9dd0-32982f217267:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This system interacts with mainframes that strictly enforce specific character encodings and filesystem permissions. Unlike modern cloud-native apps, this service is extremely sensitive to byte-level details.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYour goal is to provision the web root, process a compliance template, and verify the service output. Please read the following requirements carefully, as the automated verification suite checks for byte-for-byte exactness.\n\n### 1. Filesystem Configuration\n\nThe service requires a specific directory structure to host its static assets. \n\n*   **Location:** You must create the directory `/home/user/microservices/webroot`.\n*   **Permissions:** Security policy mandates that this directory must have the **Set-Group-ID (SGID)** bit set, along with standard read/execute for the group. The exact numeric mode should be `2750` (rwxr-s---).\n\n### 2. Content Generation (The \"Template\" Pipeline)\n\nYou must not create the `index.html` file from scratch. Instead, you must process a raw template located at `/var/lib/compliance/templates/banner.tpl`.\n\n**Processing Rules:**\n\n1.  **Source:** Read the `banner.tpl` file. Be aware that this file was authored on a Windows workstation; it is encoded in **UTF-8** and includes a **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** at the very beginning.\n2.  **Sanitization:** You must strip the BOM before processing.\n3.  **Substitution:** The template contains the placeholder string `{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}`. Replace this string with the value of the environment variable `TARGET_AUDIENCE`. If the variable is unset, default to `Unknown Entity`.\n4.  **Encoding Conversion:** The mainframe scrapers that will read this page *cannot* handle UTF-8. You must save the final `index.html` encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**.\n    *   *Note:* The template contains a Copyright symbol (\u00a9). In the source UTF-8 file, this is two bytes (`0xC2 0xA9`). In your output `index.html`, it must be the single byte `0xA9` defined by ISO-8859-1.\n5.  **Destination:** Save the processed file to `/home/user/microservices/webroot/index.html`.\n\n### 3. Service Execution\n\nStart a Python HTTP server to serve the content.\n\n*   **Port:** The server must listen on port **9000**.\n*   **Root:** It must serve files from `/home/user/microservices/webroot`.\n*   **Persistence:** The server must run in the background.\n\n### 4. Verification and Manifest Generation\n\nOnce the server is running, you must verify the deployment and generate a specific manifest file expected by the audit subsystem.\n\nCreate a file at `/home/user/output/audit_manifest.txt`. This file must contain exactly two lines:\n\n**Line 1:** The MD5 checksum of the `index.html` file, followed by two spaces, followed by the **relative path** of the file from the `/home/user` directory.\n*   *Format:* `<md5_hash>  microservices/webroot/index.html`\n\n**Line 2:** The exact value of the `Content-Length` HTTP header returned by the server when requesting `http://localhost:9000/index.html`.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n*   Ensure there is no trailing whitespace on any line.\n*   The manifest file itself should be UTF-8 encoded.\n*   Double-check that your MD5 hash matches the *ISO-8859-1* bytes of the file on disk, not the UTF-8 representation.\n\n## Summary of Artifacts\n\nUpon completion, the following must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/microservices/webroot/` (Mode 2750)\n2.  `/home/user/microservices/webroot/index.html` (ISO-8859-1 encoded, no BOM)\n3.  `/home/user/output/audit_manifest.txt` (Two specific lines)\n4.

A running Python HTTP process on port 9000.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@fa6955c0-6438-458e-9dd0-32982f217267:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
