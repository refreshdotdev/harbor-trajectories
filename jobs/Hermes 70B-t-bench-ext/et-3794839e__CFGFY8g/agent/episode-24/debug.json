Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Legacy Migration & Consolidation Task\n\nYou are the lead Data Engineer for a migration project. We are consolidating experiment logs from several generations of our ML platform. The data is messy, distributed, and uses various legacy encoding standards. Your job is to produce a clean, verified inventory.\n\n## 1. Input Sources\n\nThe experiment data resides in `/home/user/mlops/experiments/`. Each subdirectory represents an experiment. Within these directories, you must process any file named `artifacts.txt` or `artifacts.log`. \n\n**Warning**: Some of these files were generated by Windows systems (UTF-16LE with BOM) or older Linux systems (Latin-1). You must detect and handle these encodings automatically. If a file is standard UTF-8, process it normally.\n\n## 2. Data Hygiene & Parsing Protocols\n\nEach line in the log files follows the format: `ArtifactName | Status | Metadata`. \n\nBefore parsing, you must validate the line integrity. Our legacy transmission protocol used whitespace parity. **Any line ending with an odd number of trailing spaces (excluding the newline character) is considered corrupted.** \n- You must NOT include corrupted lines in the inventory.\n- You must write these corrupted lines exactly as they appear (bytes preserved) to `/home/user/mlops/summary/corruption_report.txt`.\n\nFor valid lines:\n1.  Extract `ArtifactName` and `Status`.\n2.  **Status Override**: Some experiments contain a `status_override.map` file (key=value format). If an artifact name appears in this map, the mapped status takes precedence over the log status.\n3.  Filter: Keep ONLY artifacts where the final resolved status is `READY`.\n\n## 3. Exclusion Policy\n\nWe have a directory of deprecated assets at `/home/user/mlops/deprecated/`. This directory contains empty placeholder files. \n\n- You must exclude any artifact whose **root name** (filename without extension) matches a filename in the `deprecated` folder (also without extension).\n- This matching must be **case-insensitive**.\n- Example: If `deprecated/Legacy_Model.old` exists, then `legacy_model.pt` in the logs must be excluded.\n\n## 4. Output Specifications\n\nYou must generate a pipe-delimited inventory file at `/home/user/mlops/summary/inventory.csv`.\n\n**Header**: `Artifact|NameHash|Locations`\n\n**Columns**:\n1.  `Artifact`: The trimmed artifact name.\n2.  `NameHash`: The MD5 hash of the trimmed artifact name (hex digest).\n3.  `Locations`: A sorted, semicolon-separated list of **relative paths** from `/home/user/mlops/` to the experiment directory (e.g., `experiments/exp_alpha`).\n\n**Sorting**:\n- Rows must be sorted alphabetically by `Artifact` (case-sensitive, standard POSIX sort).\n\n## 5. Final Verification (The Manifest)\n\nTo ensure auditability, you must produce a YAML manifest at `/home/user/mlops/summary/manifest.yaml` containing:\n- `total_artifacts`: The number of unique artifacts in the final inventory.\n- `inventory_hash`: The SHA-256 checksum of the generated `inventory.csv` file.\n- `generated_at`: The current UTC date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n\n### Constraints\n- Do not use external libraries beyond the Python standard library.\n- Work entirely within `/home/user/`.\n- Ensure all output files are encoded in UTF-8.\n- The `summary` directory does not exist and must be created.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b482f734-1188-432f-ace5-8ff61d828115:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Legacy Migration & Consolidation Task\n\nYou are the lead Data Engineer for a migration project. We are consolidating experiment logs from several generations of our ML platform. The data is messy, distributed, and uses various legacy encoding standards. Your job is to produce a clean, verified inventory.\n\n## 1. Input Sources\n\nThe experiment data resides in `/home/user/mlops/experiments/`. Each subdirectory represents an experiment. Within these directories, you must process any file named `artifacts.txt` or `artifacts.log`. \n\n**Warning**: Some of these files were generated by Windows systems (UTF-16LE with BOM) or older Linux systems (Latin-1). You must detect and handle these encodings automatically. If a file is standard UTF-8, process it normally.\n\n## 2. Data Hygiene & Parsing Protocols\n\nEach line in the log files follows the format: `ArtifactName | Status | Metadata`. \n\nBefore parsing, you must validate the line integrity. Our legacy transmission protocol used whitespace parity. **Any line ending with an odd number of trailing spaces (excluding the newline character) is considered corrupted.** \n- You must NOT include corrupted lines in the inventory.\n- You must write these corrupted lines exactly as they appear (bytes preserved) to `/home/user/mlops/summary/corruption_report.txt`.\n\nFor valid lines:\n1.  Extract `ArtifactName` and `Status`.\n2.  **Status Override**: Some experiments contain a `status_override.map` file (key=value format). If an artifact name appears in this map, the mapped status takes precedence over the log status.\n3.  Filter: Keep ONLY artifacts where the final resolved status is `READY`.\n\n## 3. Exclusion Policy\n\nWe have a directory of deprecated assets at `/home/user/mlops/deprecated/`. This directory contains empty placeholder files. \n\n- You must exclude any artifact whose **root name** (filename without extension) matches a filename in the `deprecated` folder (also without extension).\n- This matching must be **case-insensitive**.\n- Example: If `deprecated/Legacy_Model.old` exists, then `legacy_model.pt` in the logs must be excluded.\n\n## 4. Output Specifications\n\nYou must generate a pipe-delimited inventory file at `/home/user/mlops/summary/inventory.csv`.\n\n**Header**: `Artifact|NameHash|Locations`\n\n**Columns**:\n1.  `Artifact`: The trimmed artifact name.\n2.  `NameHash`: The MD5 hash of the trimmed artifact name (hex digest).\n3.  `Locations`: A sorted, semicolon-separated list of **relative paths** from `/home/user/mlops/` to the experiment directory (e.g., `experiments/exp_alpha`).\n\n**Sorting**:\n- Rows must be sorted alphabetically by `Artifact` (case-sensitive, standard POSIX sort).\n\n## 5. Final Verification (The Manifest)\n\nTo ensure auditability, you must produce a YAML manifest at `/home/user/mlops/summary/manifest.yaml` containing:\n- `total_artifacts`: The number of unique artifacts in the final inventory.\n- `inventory_hash`: The SHA-256 checksum of the generated `inventory.csv` file.\n- `generated_at`: The current UTC date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n\n### Constraints\n- Do not use external libraries beyond the Python standard library.\n- Work entirely within `/home/user/`.\n- Ensure all output files are encoded in UTF-8.\n- The `summary` directory does not exist and must be created.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b482f734-1188-432f-ace5-8ff61d828115:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Legacy Migration & Consolidation Task\n\nYou are the lead Data Engineer for a migration project. We are consolidating experiment logs from several generations of our ML platform. The data is messy, distributed, and uses various legacy encoding standards. Your job is to produce a clean, verified inventory.\n\n## 1. Input Sources\n\nThe experiment data resides in `/home/user/mlops/experiments/`. Each subdirectory represents an experiment. Within these directories, you must process any file named `artifacts.txt` or `artifacts.log`. \n\n**Warning**: Some of these files were generated by Windows systems (UTF-16LE with BOM) or older Linux systems (Latin-1). You must detect and handle these encodings automatically. If a file is standard UTF-8, process it normally.\n\n## 2. Data Hygiene & Parsing Protocols\n\nEach line in the log files follows the format: `ArtifactName | Status | Metadata`. \n\nBefore parsing, you must validate the line integrity. Our legacy transmission protocol used whitespace parity. **Any line ending with an odd number of trailing spaces (excluding the newline character) is considered corrupted.** \n- You must NOT include corrupted lines in the inventory.\n- You must write these corrupted lines exactly as they appear (bytes preserved) to `/home/user/mlops/summary/corruption_report.txt`.\n\nFor valid lines:\n1.  Extract `ArtifactName` and `Status`.\n2.  **Status Override**: Some experiments contain a `status_override.map` file (key=value format). If an artifact name appears in this map, the mapped status takes precedence over the log status.\n3.  Filter: Keep ONLY artifacts where the final resolved status is `READY`.\n\n## 3. Exclusion Policy\n\nWe have a directory of deprecated assets at `/home/user/mlops/deprecated/`. This directory contains empty placeholder files. \n\n- You must exclude any artifact whose **root name** (filename without extension) matches a filename in the `deprecated` folder (also without extension).\n- This matching must be **case-insensitive**.\n- Example: If `deprecated/Legacy_Model.old` exists, then `legacy_model.pt` in the logs must be excluded.\n\n## 4. Output Specifications\n\nYou must generate a pipe-delimited inventory file at `/home/user/mlops/summary/inventory.csv`.\n\n**Header**: `Artifact|NameHash|Locations`\n\n**Columns**:\n1.  `Artifact`: The trimmed artifact name.\n2.  `NameHash`: The MD5 hash of the trimmed artifact name (hex digest).\n3.  `Locations`: A sorted, semicolon-separated list of **relative paths** from `/home/user/mlops/` to the experiment directory (e.g., `experiments/exp_alpha`).\n\n**Sorting**:\n- Rows must be sorted alphabetically by `Artifact` (case-sensitive, standard POSIX sort).\n\n## 5. Final Verification (The Manifest)\n\nTo ensure auditability, you must produce a YAML manifest at `/home/user/mlops/summary/manifest.yaml` containing:\n- `total_artifacts`: The number of unique artifacts in the final inventory.\n- `inventory_hash`: The SHA-256 checksum of the generated `inventory.csv` file.\n- `generated_at`: The current UTC date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n\n### Constraints\n- Do not use external libraries beyond the Python standard library.\n- Work entirely within `/home/user/`.\n- Ensure all output files are encoded in UTF-8.\n- The `summary` directory does not exist and must be created.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b482f734-1188-432f-ace5-8ff61d828115:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
