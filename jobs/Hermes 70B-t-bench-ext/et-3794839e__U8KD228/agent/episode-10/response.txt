This pattern strongly suggests there are fundamental issues with the terminal environment that are preventing command execution or output display. The system appears to be accepting commands but not providing any feedback or results.",

I'll attempt to create a simple test file directly in the current directory using basic shell operations, then immediately check if it was created. This will help determine if the file system is responsive.",
