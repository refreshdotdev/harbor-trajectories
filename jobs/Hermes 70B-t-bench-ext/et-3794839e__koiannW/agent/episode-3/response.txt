  "analysis": "The output files have been generated correctly. Analysis shows: 1) The corruption report is empty, indicating no corrupted lines were found in the test data. 2) The inventory.csv contains the expected 4 artifacts with proper formatting, headers, and sorted order. 3) The manifest.yaml contains accurate metadata including the correct artifact count and SHA-256 hash for the inventory file. 4) The wc -l and md5sum commands confirm the file integrity. All requirements appear to be satisfied.",

The next step is to create a final test case that specifically verifies the corruption detection logic and encoding handling capabilities. This will ensure the script works with various edge cases before considering the task complete.",
