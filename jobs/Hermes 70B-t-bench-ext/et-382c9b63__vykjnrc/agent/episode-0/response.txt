  "analysis": "I've analyzed the task requirements. The goal is to process Nmap log files from specific locations, filter them based on date and content, and generate two output artifacts: a JSON manifest and a UTF-16LE encoded CSV file with specific formatting and sorting. The CSV also requires a runtime comment. I need to use standard Linux utilities. No prior work has been done, so I'll start from the beginning.",
  "plan": "My plan involves several stages:\n1.  Create the output directory `/home/user/ingest/`.\n2.  Identify all `.log` files in `/home/user/scan_logs/` and `/home/user/scan_logs/archive/`, excluding any in `backup` subdirectories.\n3.  For each candidate log file, parse its header to determine the scan date. Only files scanned in May 2023 will be processed.\n4.  For valid May 2023 logs, calculate their SHA256 checksums and compile this information into a JSON manifest file (`manifest.json`).\n5.  Parse the valid Nmap logs to extract host IPs, open ports, scan duration, and calculate Ports Per Second (PPS).\n6.  Determine which hosts are 'Critical Gateways' (ports 80 and 443 open).\n7.  Sort the extracted data: Critical Gateways first, then other hosts, sorted by IP address within each group.\n8.  Format the data into a CSV string with specific column requirements (e.g., double-quoted open ports, 8-char hash prefix, PPS rounding).\n9.  Convert this CSV string to UTF-16LE encoding with a BOM.\n10. Append a runtime comment (also UTF-16LE) to the CSV data.\n11. Write the final UTF-16LE CSV data to `cyber_core_import.csv`.\n12. Display the content of `manifest.json` to the console.\nI will use a combination of `find`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `sha256sum`, `date`, `iconv`, and potentially a temporary Python script (for CSV generation and encoding) or careful `awk`/`printf` usage for the CSV part.",
