  "analysis": "The `jq` command failed because the `jq` utility is not installed on this system. The `awk` script for parsing `traffic.log` also failed because the `gensub` function is not available, indicating a non-GNU version of `awk` or one lacking this extension. This means my initial plan for Phase 1 parsing is not viable with the current toolset. I need to adapt by using only basic POSIX-compliant shell commands, `grep`, `cut`, `awk` (standard features), and `sed`.",
  "plan": "I will re-implement the Phase 1 logic using more basic tools.\n1.  Parse `threat_intel.json` for active IPs: Use `grep` and `cut` to extract IPs from lines containing `\"status\": \"active\"` and then parse the IP itself. Store these in a temporary file.\n2.  Parse `maintenance_schedule.txt` for exclusion window: This was successful and `EXCLUSION_START` and `EXCLUSION_END` variables are set.\n3.  Analyze `traffic.log`:\n    a.  Filter lines where the source IP is in the list of active threat IPs.\n    b.  Convert date strings to timestamps for comparison (this will be more manual without `gensub` and `mktime`, or rely on string comparison if ISO8601 format allows it).\n    c.  Filter out packets falling within the exclusion window.\n    d.  Aggregate packet counts per IP.\nThis will require a more iterative approach, possibly using shell loops or more complex `awk` without GNU extensions, or a series of `grep` and `sort` commands. Given the complexity, I'll start by creating the list of active IPs.",
