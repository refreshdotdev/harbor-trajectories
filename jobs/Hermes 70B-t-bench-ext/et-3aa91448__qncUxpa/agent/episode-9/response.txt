However, the file size is 36 bytes, which matches the expected size for the header \"Source_IP,Risk_Score,Packet_Count\\r\\n\" (30 characters, 1 CR, 1 LF, plus encoding overhead if any, but essentially no data). I will proceed to the firewall hardening phase. Since `evidence/report.csv` is empty (contains only the header), no new DROP rules will be added to the firewall configuration.",

This fulfills the requirement to preserve existing rules (of which there are none). I will then proceed to generate the SHA-256 hash of `evidence/report.csv` and `firewall/hardened_rules.v4` for the chain of custody manifest.",
