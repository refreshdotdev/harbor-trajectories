  "analysis": "I am starting with a clean state in the home directory of the root user. The task requires me to create a specific directory structure in `/home/user/workflows/image_cleanup`, clean up a data file `/home/user/sample_images.txt` and place the result in a new location, create an executable shell script, and generate a detailed log file. The current terminal output shows I am in `/root` and no workflow directories exist yet.",
  "plan": "My first step is to create the main `workflows` directory structure. I'll then navigate into it to create the `image_cleanup` subdirectory and its required subdirectories (`input`, `output`, `temp`). I will specifically ensure the `temp` directory gets the sticky bit permission. After setting up the structure, I'll process the `sample_images.txt` file according to the cleaning rules and save the clean result into the `input` directory. Then, I'll create the `run.sh` script and make it executable. Finally, I will generate the `setup.log` file with the correct format and content.",
