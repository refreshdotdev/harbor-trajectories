  "analysis": "The verification using `ls -la` confirms that the directory structure is set up correctly. The `image_cleanup` directory contains the subdirectories `input` (with the empty `files_to_process.txt`), `output`, and `temp`. The shell script `run.sh` is also in place. The `stat` command confirms that the `temp` directory has permissions `1755` with the sticky bit set (`drwxr-xr-t`), satisfying the crucial security requirement. The groundwork is now fully prepared.",
  "plan": "The next phase involves creating the messy sample data file that needs to be cleaned. I will create the file `/home/user/sample_images.txt` with intentionally messy content that includes mixed-case filenames, leading/trailing whitespace, empty lines, and various file extensions. This will simulate the real-world scenario described in the task. After creating the file, I will use `cat` to display its contents to verify that it has the expected messy format.",
