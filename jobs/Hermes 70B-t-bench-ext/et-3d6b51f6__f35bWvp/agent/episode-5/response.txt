This is because the script is executed from the `/root` directory, and the relative path `input/files_to_process.txt` is resolved relative to the current working directory rather than the script's location. I will modify the script to use an absolute path or to change the working directory to the script's location before accessing the file.",
  "plan": "I will edit the `run.sh` script to ensure it can reliably locate and read the `files_to_process.txt` file. I will change the script to first determine its own directory using `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` and then refer to the data file using the absolute path constructed from the script's directory and the relative path to the data file. This will make the script robust regardless of the current working directory when it is executed.",
