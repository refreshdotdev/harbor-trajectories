            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a database administrator who has been asked to formalise the way ad-hoc SQL files are \u201coptimised\u201d. A colleague left you an initial scratch directory, but the process needs to be robust, handle batch processing via environment variables, and produce structured metadata.\n\nA colleague already placed a raw SQL batch file here (this file already exists when you start):\n`/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_42.sql`\n\nYour goal is to produce a final state that meets the following specifications:\n\n*   A dedicated, *user-local* Python virtual environment exists at `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries`.\n    *   The directory must have the standard structure of a Python virtual environment.\n    *   Inside this environment, version **0.4.4** of the PyPI package \u201csqlparse\u201d must be installed.\n    *   A dependency lock file named `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt` must exist containing `sqlparse==0.4.4`.\n\n*   A Python script named `/home/user/db_queries/process_batch.py` exists. The script must:\n    *   Be runnable with the venv\u2019s `python`.\n    *   Read an environment variable named `DB_BATCH_ID` to determine which file to process. (For testing, you will use `DB_BATCH_ID=42`).\n    *   Read the input file `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql`.\n    *   Create a *verbatim* backup of the input file at `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_backup.sql`.\n    *   Process each query in the input file using `sqlparse`:\n        1.  Calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *original raw query string* (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace). This will be used for tracking.\n        2.  Produce a **single-line** version of the query with SQL keywords upper-cased and spaces around comparison operators (e.g., \u201csalary>50000\u201d \u2192 \u201c... salary > 50000 ...\u201d). Ensure newlines are replaced by spaces.\n        3.  Append a comment to the end of the optimized query in the format: ` -- id={md5_hash}`.\n    *   Classify queries and write them to separate files (preserving order within each category):\n        *   **Read Queries** (starting with `SELECT`, case-insensitive) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_read.sql`.\n        *   **Write Queries** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_write.sql`.\n    *   Ensure every SQL statement in the output files ends with a semicolon.\n\n*   A JSON manifest file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_manifest.json` is created containing exactly:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"batch_id\": \"{DB_BATCH_ID}\",\n      \"read_count\": <integer>,\n      \"write_count\": <integer>\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   A plain-text log file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_pipeline.log` is created containing exactly these lines:\n    ```text\n    PIPELINE START\n    Batch ID: {DB_BATCH_ID}\n    Input: raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql\n    Processed: <total_queries>\n    PIPELINE END\n    ```\n\n**Example for Batch 42:**\nIf `raw_batch_42.sql` contains `select * from t;`, the script (run with `DB_BATCH_ID=42`) should produce:\n1. `raw_batch_42_backup.sql` (copy of original)\n2. `batch_42_optimized_read.sql` containing: `SELECT * FROM t; -- id=<md5_of_original>`\n3. `batch_42_optimized_write.sql` (empty if no write queries)\n4. `batch_42_manifest.json`\n5. `batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nAs a final result, print the following to the terminal:\n*   the first two lines of `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_manifest.json`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nNo root privileges are needed. Everything must be achievable from an ordinary user shell.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@b82784c7-2a45-4d16-9e1a-4e0b54903093:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a database administrator who has been asked to formalise the way ad-hoc SQL files are \u201coptimised\u201d. A colleague left you an initial scratch directory, but the process needs to be robust, handle batch processing via environment variables, and produce structured metadata.\n\nA colleague already placed a raw SQL batch file here (this file already exists when you start):\n`/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_42.sql`\n\nYour goal is to produce a final state that meets the following specifications:\n\n*   A dedicated, *user-local* Python virtual environment exists at `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries`.\n    *   The directory must have the standard structure of a Python virtual environment.\n    *   Inside this environment, version **0.4.4** of the PyPI package \u201csqlparse\u201d must be installed.\n    *   A dependency lock file named `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt` must exist containing `sqlparse==0.4.4`.\n\n*   A Python script named `/home/user/db_queries/process_batch.py` exists. The script must:\n    *   Be runnable with the venv\u2019s `python`.\n    *   Read an environment variable named `DB_BATCH_ID` to determine which file to process. (For testing, you will use `DB_BATCH_ID=42`).\n    *   Read the input file `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql`.\n    *   Create a *verbatim* backup of the input file at `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_backup.sql`.\n    *   Process each query in the input file using `sqlparse`:\n        1.  Calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *original raw query string* (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace). This will be used for tracking.\n        2.  Produce a **single-line** version of the query with SQL keywords upper-cased and spaces around comparison operators (e.g., \u201csalary>50000\u201d \u2192 \u201c... salary > 50000 ...\u201d). Ensure newlines are replaced by spaces.\n        3.  Append a comment to the end of the optimized query in the format: ` -- id={md5_hash}`.\n    *   Classify queries and write them to separate files (preserving order within each category):\n        *   **Read Queries** (starting with `SELECT`, case-insensitive) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_read.sql`.\n        *   **Write Queries** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_write.sql`.\n    *   Ensure every SQL statement in the output files ends with a semicolon.\n\n*   A JSON manifest file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_manifest.json` is created containing exactly:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"batch_id\": \"{DB_BATCH_ID}\",\n      \"read_count\": <integer>,\n      \"write_count\": <integer>\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   A plain-text log file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_pipeline.log` is created containing exactly these lines:\n    ```text\n    PIPELINE START\n    Batch ID: {DB_BATCH_ID}\n    Input: raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql\n    Processed: <total_queries>\n    PIPELINE END\n    ```\n\n**Example for Batch 42:**\nIf `raw_batch_42.sql` contains `select * from t;`, the script (run with `DB_BATCH_ID=42`) should produce:\n1. `raw_batch_42_backup.sql` (copy of original)\n2. `batch_42_optimized_read.sql` containing: `SELECT * FROM t; -- id=<md5_of_original>`\n3. `batch_42_optimized_write.sql` (empty if no write queries)\n4. `batch_42_manifest.json`\n5. `batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nAs a final result, print the following to the terminal:\n*   the first two lines of `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_manifest.json`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nNo root privileges are needed.

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why?

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a database administrator who has been asked to formalise the way ad-hoc SQL files are \u201coptimised\u201d. A colleague left you an initial scratch directory, but the process needs to be robust, handle batch processing via environment variables, and produce structured metadata.\n\nA colleague already placed a raw SQL batch file here (this file already exists when you start):\n`/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_42.sql`\n\nYour goal is to produce a final state that meets the following specifications:\n\n*   A dedicated, *user-local* Python virtual environment exists at `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries`.\n    *   The directory must have the standard structure of a Python virtual environment.\n    *   Inside this environment, version **0.4.4** of the PyPI package \u201csqlparse\u201d must be installed.\n    *   A dependency lock file named `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt` must exist containing `sqlparse==0.4.4`.\n\n*   A Python script named `/home/user/db_queries/process_batch.py` exists. The script must:\n    *   Be runnable with the venv\u2019s `python`.\n    *   Read an environment variable named `DB_BATCH_ID` to determine which file to process. (For testing, you will use `DB_BATCH_ID=42`).\n    *   Read the input file `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql`.\n    *   Create a *verbatim* backup of the input file at `/home/user/db_queries/raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_backup.sql`.\n    *   Process each query in the input file using `sqlparse`:\n        1.  Calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *original raw query string* (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace). This will be used for tracking.\n        2.  Produce a **single-line** version of the query with SQL keywords upper-cased and spaces around comparison operators (e.g., \u201csalary>50000\u201d \u2192 \u201c... salary > 50000 ...\u201d). Ensure newlines are replaced by spaces.\n        3.  Append a comment to the end of the optimized query in the format: ` -- id={md5_hash}`.\n    *   Classify queries and write them to separate files (preserving order within each category):\n        *   **Read Queries** (starting with `SELECT`, case-insensitive) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_read.sql`.\n        *   **Write Queries** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) go to `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_optimized_write.sql`.\n    *   Ensure every SQL statement in the output files ends with a semicolon.\n\n*   A JSON manifest file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_manifest.json` is created containing exactly:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"batch_id\": \"{DB_BATCH_ID}\",\n      \"read_count\": <integer>,\n      \"write_count\": <integer>\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   A plain-text log file named `/home/user/db_queries/batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}_pipeline.log` is created containing exactly these lines:\n    ```text\n    PIPELINE START\n    Batch ID: {DB_BATCH_ID}\n    Input: raw_batch_{DB_BATCH_ID}.sql\n    Processed: <total_queries>\n    PIPELINE END\n    ```\n\n**Example for Batch 42:**\nIf `raw_batch_42.sql` contains `select * from t;`, the script (run with `DB_BATCH_ID=42`) should produce:\n1. `raw_batch_42_backup.sql` (copy of original)\n2. `batch_42_optimized_read.sql` containing: `SELECT * FROM t; -- id=<md5_of_original>`\n3. `batch_42_optimized_write.sql` (empty if no write queries)\n4. `batch_42_manifest.json`\n5. `batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nAs a final result, print the following to the terminal:\n*   the first two lines of `/home/user/.venvs/opt_queries/requirements.txt`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_manifest.json`\n*   the full contents of `/home/user/db_queries/batch_42_pipeline.log`\n\nNo root privileges are needed.
