On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds.

You have been assigned ticket **SEC-4022**: *\"Automate the generation of the daily infrastructure snapshot report.\"*\n\nThis pipeline runs on an older compliance server but processes data from modern cloud instances. The output is consumed by two disparate systems: a modern SIEM dashboard (Splunk) and a legacy Mainframe Audit Tape (MAT) system. Because of this hybrid environment, **strict adherence to file encoding and formatting standards is mandatory**.\n\n## Environment & Inputs\n\nThe following read-only files are present in the workspace:\n\n1.  `/home/user/sample_data/mock_netstat.txt`: A snapshot of open ports. Note that this file may contain IPv4 listeners on both loopback and wildcard interfaces.\n2.  `/home/user/sample_data/mock_passwd`: A copy of the `/etc/passwd` file from the target host.\n3.  `/home/user/sample_data/service_names.csv`: A mapping of port/protocols to service names. \n    *   **WARNING**: This file is exported daily from a Windows-based IPAM solution. It is encoded in UTF-8 but, being a Windows export, often includes a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start which must be stripped before processing.\n4.  `/home/user/config/user_blacklist.txt`: A list of usernames that are authorized and should NOT appear in the insecure users report.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\nYou must write a Bash script at `/home/user/reports/run_security_scan.sh` that orchestrates the scanning process.\n\n### 1. Parallel Processing Strategy\nTo meet SLA requirements, the script must launch two distinct analysis jobs in parallel. The main script must capture the exact start time (Unix epoch) before launching jobs, wait for both to complete, and capture the end time immediately after.\n\n### 2. Job 1: Network Exposure Analysis\nProcess `mock_netstat.txt` to identify listening services.\n*   **Filter**: Select only lines where the state is `LISTEN` or the protocol is `udp`.\n*   **Enrichment**: Match the `port/protocol` (e.g., `80/tcp`) against `service_names.csv`. If a match is found, append the service name to the process name in parentheses (e.g., `nginx (http)`). If the service name in the CSV contains non-ASCII characters, they must be preserved.\n*   **Scope Classification**: \n    *   If the local address is `0.0.0.0`, the protocol column in the output must be prefixed with `public-` (e.g., `public-tcp`).\n    *   If the local address is `127.0.0.1`, prefix with `local-` (e.g., `local-tcp`).\n    *   Otherwise, leave the protocol as is.\n*   **Output**: Generate an intermediate list sorted numerically by port.\n\n### 3. Job 2: User Audit\nProcess `mock_passwd` to identify potentially insecure user accounts.\n*   **Criteria**: Identify users with UID < `UID_LIMIT` (default **1000**).\n*   **Exclusions**: \n    *   Exclude any user listed in `user_blacklist.txt`.\n    *   Exclude any user whose login shell is set to `/bin/false` (these are considered secured service accounts).\n*   **Output**: Generate an intermediate list of usernames sorted alphabetically.\n\n### 4. Reporting & Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\nOnce the jobs are finished, you must generate two artifacts in `/home/user/reports/`.\n\n**Artifact A: The Mainframe Report (`infra_security_report.yml`)**\nThis YAML file aggregates the results. \n*   **Encoding**: The Mainframe Audit Tape system is pre-Unicode. The final YAML file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. Any UTF-8 characters from the inputs (like service names) must be converted. Failure to do so will cause the mainframe ingestor to crash.\n*   **Integrity Check**: The report must include a `meta` section containing an `input_hash`. This hash is the MD5 checksum of the *concatenation* of the two raw input files (`mock_netstat.txt` followed immediately by `mock_passwd`).\n*   **Structure**: See the example below. Strict indentation (2 spaces) is required.\n\n**Artifact B: The SIEM Log (`scan_exec_time.log`)**\n*   **Format**: A CSV containing `start_epoch,end_epoch,duration`.\n*   **Line Endings**: The Windows-based SIEM agent requires this specific file to use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings. Standard Linux `\\n` will result in the log being rejected.\n\n### Example YAML Output\n*(Note: The actual file must be ISO-8859-1 encoded)*\n```yaml\n---\nmeta:\n  input_hash: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592\ninsecure_users:\n  - bin\n  - root\nopen_ports:\n  - port: 22\n    protocol: public-tcp\n    process: sshd (ssh)\n  - port: 3306\n    protocol: local-tcp\n    process: mysqld (mysql)\n  - port: 9000\n    protocol: public-tcp\n    process: proxy (Bj\u00f6rnApp)\n```\n\n## Constraints\n*   The script must be executable and return exit code 0.\n*   Temporary files must be cleaned up, but the script is permitted to use `/tmp` during execution.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   The solution must use standard Linux tools installed in the environment (bash, awk, sed, grep, iconv, md5sum).\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@76343478-bab0-4967-8cd8-dc349a5172f7:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Job 2: User Audit\nProcess `mock_passwd` to identify potentially insecure user accounts.\n*   **Criteria**: Identify users with UID < `UID_LIMIT` (default **1000**).\n*   **Exclusions**: \n    *   Exclude any user listed in `user_blacklist.txt`.\n    *   Exclude any user whose login shell is set to `/bin/false` (these are considered secured service accounts).\n*   **Output**: Generate an intermediate list of usernames sorted alphabetically.\n\n### 4. Reporting & Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\nOnce the jobs are finished, you must generate two artifacts in `/home/user/reports/`.\n\n**Artifact A: The Mainframe Report (`infra_security_report.yml`)**\nThis YAML file aggregates the results. \n*   **Encoding**: The Mainframe Audit Tape system is pre-Unicode. The final YAML file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. Any UTF-8 characters from the inputs (like service names) must be converted. Failure to do so will cause the mainframe ingestor to crash.\n*   **Integrity Check**: The report must include a `meta` section containing an `input_hash`. This hash is the MD5 checksum of the *concatenation* of the two raw input files (`mock_netstat.txt` followed immediately by `mock_passwd`).\n*   **Structure**: See the example below. Strict indentation (2 spaces) is required.\n\n**Artifact B: The SIEM Log (`scan_exec_time.log`)**\n*   **Format**: A CSV containing `start_epoch,end_epoch,duration`.\n*   **Line Endings**: The Windows-based SIEM agent requires this specific file to use **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings. Standard Linux `\\n` will result in the log being rejected.\n\n### Example YAML Output\n*(Note: The actual file must be ISO-8859-1 encoded)*\n```yaml\n---\nmeta:\n  input_hash: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592\ninsecure_users:\n  - bin\n  - root\nopen_ports:\n  - port: 22\n    protocol: public-tcp\n    process: sshd (ssh)\n  - port: 3306\n    protocol: local-tcp\n    process: mysqld (mysql)\n  - port: 9000\n    protocol: public-tcp\n    process: proxy (Bj\u00f6rnApp)\n```\n\n## Constraints\n*   The script must be executable and return exit code 0.\n*   Temporary files must be cleaned up, but the script is permitted to use `/tmp` during execution.\n*   Do not modify the input files.\n*   The solution must use standard Linux tools installed in the environment (bash, awk, sed, grep, iconv, md5sum).\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@76343478-bab0-4967-8cd8-dc349a5172f7:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Enterprise Security Baseline Automation (SOP-992)\n\nYou are a DevOps Engineer at a legacy financial institution. You have been assigned ticket **SEC-4022**: *\"Automate the generation of the daily infrastructure snapshot report.\"*\n\nThis pipeline runs on an older compliance server but processes data from modern cloud instances. The output is consumed by two disparate systems: a modern SIEM dashboard (Splunk) and a legacy Mainframe Audit Tape (MAT) system. Because of this hybrid environment, **strict adherence to file encoding and formatting standards is mandatory**.\n\n## Environment & Inputs\n\nThe following read-only files are present in the workspace:\n\n1.  `/home/user/sample_data/mock_netstat.txt`: A snapshot of open ports. Note that this file may contain IPv4 listeners on both loopback and wildcard interfaces.\n2.  `/home/user/sample_data/mock_passwd`: A copy of the `/etc/passwd` file from the target host.\n3.  `/home/user/sample_data/service_names.csv`: A mapping of port/protocols to service names. \n    *   **WARNING**: This file is exported daily from a Windows-based IPAM solution. It is encoded in UTF-8 but, being a Windows export, often includes a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start which must be stripped before processing.\n4.  `/home/user/config/user_blacklist.txt`: A list of usernames that are authorized and should NOT appear in the insecure users report.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\nYou must write a Bash script at `/home/user/reports/run_security_scan.sh` that orchestrates the scanning process.\n\n### 1. Parallel Processing Strategy\nTo meet SLA requirements, the script must launch two distinct analysis jobs in parallel. The main script must capture the exact start time (Unix epoch) before launching jobs, wait for both to complete, and capture the end time immediately after.\n\n### 2. Job 1: Network Exposure Analysis\nProcess `mock_netstat.txt` to identify listening services.\n*   **Filter**: Select only lines where the state is `LISTEN` or the protocol is `udp`.\n*   **Enrichment**: Match the `port/protocol` (e.g., `80/tcp`) against `service_names.csv`. If a match is found, append the service name to the process name in parentheses (e.g., `nginx (http)`). If the service name in the CSV contains non-ASCII characters, they must be preserved.\n*   **Scope Classification**: \n    *   If the local address is `0.0.0.0`, the protocol column in the output must be prefixed with `public-` (e.g., `public-tcp`).\n    *   If the local address is `127.0.0.1`, prefix with `local-` (e.g., `local-tcp`).\n    *   Otherwise, leave the protocol as is.\n*   **Output**: Generate an intermediate list sorted numerically by port.\n\n### 3. Job 2: User Audit\nProcess `mock_passwd` to identify potentially insecure user accounts.\n*   **Criteria**: Identify users with UID < `UID_LIMIT` (default **1000**).\n*   **Exclusions**: \n    *   Exclude any user listed in `user_blacklist.txt`.\n    *   Exclude any user whose login shell is set to `/bin/false` (these are considered secured service accounts).\n*   **Output**: Generate an intermediate list of usernames sorted alphabetically.\n\n### 4.
