  "analysis": "The system is currently in an initial state, with the user logged in as root. The task requires several steps: first, identifying the active log file by reading `/var/lib/ci_logs/manifest.xml` and extracting the filename from the `<active_log>` tag. Then, the active log file (e.g., `build_data_2023-09-05_08-30-00.json`) must be processed to remove C-style comments (`//...`). After that, an SQLite database needs to be created at `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/builds.db` with two tables: `builds` and `artifacts`. The data from the cleaned JSON log will be transformed and loaded into these tables, applying specific business logic for efficiency scores and verification codes. Finally, two reports must be generated in `/home/user/mobile_pipelines/report/`: a Windows-1252 encoded text summary with CRLF line endings, and a JSON integrity report containing an MD5 hash of the text summary.",
  "plan": "1. Navigate to the CI logs directory. 2. List the files to visually confirm the manifest and log files. 3. Use xmllint to parse the manifest.xml and extract the active log filename from the `<active_log>` tag. 4. Assign this filename to a shell variable. 5. Verify the active log file exists. 6. Process the active log file to remove C-style comments. 7. Create the necessary directory structure for the mobile pipelines output. 8. Initialize the SQLite database schema. 9. Load and transform the data into the database tables. 10. Generate the text summary report with correct encoding and line endings. 11. Generate the JSON integrity report with an MD5 hash of the text report.",
