You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a mobile build-engineer who must diagnose sporadic network-glitches that break CI/CD jobs.
Create a fully-automated diagnostic bundle under `/home/user/diagnostics`.

Your task is to create a POSIX-compatible shell script named `/home/user/diagnostics/run_net_checks.sh`. The directory `/home/user/diagnostics` must exist and the script must be executable by the current user.

### 1. Configuration & Input
The script must read the list of target hosts from a configuration file: `/home/user/diagnostics/targets.txt`.
*   This file contains one host per line.
*   Lines starting with `#` (comments) and empty lines must be ignored.
*   If the file does not exist, the script must exit with an error.

### 2. Log Rotation
Before running any checks, the script must handle existing logs:
*   If `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.log` exists, it must be compressed using `gzip` and moved to `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.previous.log.gz`.
*   If `netcheck.previous.log.gz` already exists, it should be overwritten.
*   A new, empty `netcheck.log` is then started.

### 3. Execution & Output Format
The script must perform the following operations IN PARALLEL for every valid host found in `targets.txt`:
*   **ping**:       run «ping -n -c 1 HOST»
*   **traceroute**: run «traceroute -n -m 5 HOST»
*   **dig**:        run «dig +short HOST A»

For each command, capture the complete STDOUT and STDERR. Because the output may contain binary or special characters, you must **Base64 encode** the combined output before writing it to the log.

The output must be appended to `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.log` atomically (no interleaving). The format for every block is:

    ===== START host=HOSTNAME check=COMMAND =====
    (Base64-encoded-output-string)
    ===== END host=HOSTNAME check=COMMAND status=EXITCODE =====

*   `HOSTNAME`: The host as read from the file.
*   `COMMAND`: One of `ping`, `traceroute`, or `dig`.
*   `EXITCODE`: The integer exit code of the command (e.g., 0 for success, non-zero for failure).

### 4. Header & Checksum
The new `netcheck.log` must start with two header lines:

    # Netcheck Report
    Timestamp: ISO-8601-UTC-STAMP

(Example timestamp: `2025-04-01T16:30:22Z`)

Finally, after all checks complete, compute the SHA-256 checksum of the final `netcheck.log` and store the hex digest (64 chars, no newline) in `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.sha256`.

### NOTES
*   **Parallelism**: Checks for different hosts/commands must run concurrently.
*   **Atomic Writes**: Use file locking (e.g., `flock`) to ensure the log file is not corrupted by parallel writes.
*   **Robustness**: The script must not crash if a network check fails (e.g., bad host); it should simply record the non-zero exit code.
*   **Dependencies**: `base64` and `gzip` are available in the environment.
*   **Paths**: Use absolute paths.
