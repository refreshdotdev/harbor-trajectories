Execution & Output Format\nThe script must perform the following operations IN PARALLEL for every valid host found in `targets.txt`:\n*   **ping**:       run \u00abping -n -c 1 HOST\u00bb\n*   **traceroute**: run \u00abtraceroute -n -m 5 HOST\u00bb\n*   **dig**:        run \u00abdig +short HOST A\u00bb\n\nFor each command, capture the complete STDOUT and STDERR.

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a mobile build-engineer who must diagnose sporadic network-glitches that break CI/CD jobs.\nCreate a fully-automated diagnostic bundle under `/home/user/diagnostics`.\n\nYour task is to create a POSIX-compatible shell script named `/home/user/diagnostics/run_net_checks.sh`. The directory `/home/user/diagnostics` must exist and the script must be executable by the current user.\n\n### 1. Configuration & Input\nThe script must read the list of target hosts from a configuration file: `/home/user/diagnostics/targets.txt`.\n*   This file contains one host per line.\n*   Lines starting with `#` (comments) and empty lines must be ignored.\n*   If the file does not exist, the script must exit with an error.\n\n### 2. Log Rotation\nBefore running any checks, the script must handle existing logs:\n*   If `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.log` exists, it must be compressed using `gzip` and moved to `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.previous.log.gz`.\n*   If `netcheck.previous.log.gz` already exists, it should be overwritten.\n*   A new, empty `netcheck.log` is then started.\n\n### 3. Execution & Output Format\nThe script must perform the following operations IN PARALLEL for every valid host found in `targets.txt`:\n*   **ping**:       run \u00abping -n -c 1 HOST\u00bb\n*   **traceroute**: run \u00abtraceroute -n -m 5 HOST\u00bb\n*   **dig**:        run \u00abdig +short HOST A\u00bb\n\nFor each command, capture the complete STDOUT and STDERR. Because the output may contain binary or special characters, you must **Base64 encode** the combined output before writing it to the log.\n\nThe output must be appended to `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.log` atomically (no interleaving). The format for every block is:\n\n    ===== START host=HOSTNAME check=COMMAND =====\n    (Base64-encoded-output-string)\n    ===== END host=HOSTNAME check=COMMAND status=EXITCODE =====\n\n*   `HOSTNAME`: The host as read from the file.\n*   `COMMAND`: One of `ping`, `traceroute`, or `dig`.\n*   `EXITCODE`: The integer exit code of the command (e.g., 0 for success, non-zero for failure).\n\n### 4. Header & Checksum\nThe new `netcheck.log` must start with two header lines:\n\n    # Netcheck Report\n    Timestamp: ISO-8601-UTC-STAMP\n\n(Example timestamp: `2025-04-01T16:30:22Z`)\n\nFinally, after all checks complete, compute the SHA-256 checksum of the final `netcheck.log` and store the hex digest (64 chars, no newline) in `/home/user/diagnostics/netcheck.sha256`.\n\n### NOTES\n*   **Parallelism**: Checks for different hosts/commands must run concurrently.\n*   **Atomic Writes**: Use file locking (e.g., `flock`) to ensure the log file is not corrupted by parallel writes.\n*   **Robustness**: The script must not crash if a network check fails (e.g., bad host); it should simply record the non-zero exit code.\n*   **Dependencies**: `base64` and `gzip` are available in the environment.\n*   **Paths**: Use absolute paths.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@81402df5-86a6-4c66-8385-7ef6e76da818:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
