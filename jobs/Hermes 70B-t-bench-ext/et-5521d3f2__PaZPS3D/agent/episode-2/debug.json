We are currently migrating our CI/CD pipelines, but we still have strict dependencies on legacy auditing systems. Your task is to set up a transient test environment, deploy a specific test case from our archives, and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Configuration & Discovery\n\nUnlike modern setups, this environment relies on a mix of environment variables and configuration files. \n\n*   **Configuration File**: You must locate the active configuration file. The path to this file is stored in the environment variable `QA_SETTINGS`. If that variable is not set, you should default to `~/.config/qa/default.ini`.\n*   **Log Location**: Inside the configuration file (which is in standard INI format), look for the `[Reporting]` section. The `log_path` key defines where the output report must be saved. \n    *   *Crucial:* If the path provided is relative, it must be resolved relative to the user's home directory (`/home/user`), regardless of your current working directory.\n\n## 2. Source Code Recovery\n\nWe do not store source code in plain text due to ancient mailing list software that corrupted indentation. \n\n*   **Archives**: Source archives are located in `/usr/local/src/archives`. \n*   **Selection Logic**: There may be multiple files in this directory. You must select the **most recently modified** file.\n*   **Extraction**: inside the selected archive, look for the content between the markers `---BEGIN_PY_PAYLOAD---` and `---END_PY_PAYLOAD---`. \n    *   The content between these markers is **Base64 encoded**.\n    *   You must decode this content to get the actual Python source code.\n\n## 3. Workspace Preparation\n\nPrepare a clean workspace at `/home/user/qa_env`. \n\n*   **Warning**: This directory is often cluttered with debris from failed runs. Ensure it is completely clean before starting. Watch out for files with unusual permissions or types.\n*   **Deployment**: Place the decoded Python source code into `/home/user/qa_env/test_sample.py`.\n*   **Intermediate Checkpoint**: Before proceeding, you must calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *decoded* Python source content (the raw bytes of the file you just created). Save this hash, as it is required for the final report.\n\n## 4. Environment Construction\n\nCreate a standard Python virtual environment in `/home/user/qa_env/venv`.\n\n*   **Dependency Management**: You must install `pytest`. However, **do not hardcode the version**. \n    *   Read the required version from the project manifest file located at `/usr/local/share/qa_manifest.json`. The JSON schema is `{\"dependencies\": {\"pytest\": \"<version>\"}}`.\n    *   Install exactly that version into the virtual environment.\n\n## 5. Execution & Reporting\n\nExecute the tests using `pytest` in quiet mode. Then, generate the final report at the location identified in Step 1.\n\n### Report Format & Legacy Compliance\n\nOur auditing system runs on legacy Windows servers. Therefore, the output file must strictly adhere to the following binary formats:\n\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). UTF-8 is NOT accepted.\n*   **Line Endings**: Every line must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not Unix LF.\n\n**Content Structure** (3 lines total):\n1.  The first line of `pytest`'s output (usually a single dot `.` or similar status char).\n2.  The current **Session ID**. This is found in the environment variable `QA_SESSION_ID`. If that variable is missing, read it from `/etc/qa_session`.\n3.  The **MD5 hash** of the decoded `test_sample.py` calculated in Step 3.\n\n**Final Deliverable Checklist**:\n*   `/home/user/qa_env/test_sample.py` exists with correct decoded content.\n*   Virtual environment is active and has the correct pytest version.\n*   The log file exists at the configured path, has ISO-8859-1 encoding, CRLF line endings, and exactly 3 lines of content.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c659e59d-31af-43df-a9a5-bdce4973f966:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# QA Environment Setup & Legacy Compliance Task\n\nYou have been assigned to the Internal Tooling Team. We are currently migrating our CI/CD pipelines, but we still have strict dependencies on legacy auditing systems. Your task is to set up a transient test environment, deploy a specific test case from our archives, and generate a compliance report.\n\n## 1. Configuration & Discovery\n\nUnlike modern setups, this environment relies on a mix of environment variables and configuration files. \n\n*   **Configuration File**: You must locate the active configuration file. The path to this file is stored in the environment variable `QA_SETTINGS`. If that variable is not set, you should default to `~/.config/qa/default.ini`.\n*   **Log Location**: Inside the configuration file (which is in standard INI format), look for the `[Reporting]` section. The `log_path` key defines where the output report must be saved. \n    *   *Crucial:* If the path provided is relative, it must be resolved relative to the user's home directory (`/home/user`), regardless of your current working directory.\n\n## 2. Source Code Recovery\n\nWe do not store source code in plain text due to ancient mailing list software that corrupted indentation. \n\n*   **Archives**: Source archives are located in `/usr/local/src/archives`. \n*   **Selection Logic**: There may be multiple files in this directory. You must select the **most recently modified** file.\n*   **Extraction**: inside the selected archive, look for the content between the markers `---BEGIN_PY_PAYLOAD---` and `---END_PY_PAYLOAD---`. \n    *   The content between these markers is **Base64 encoded**.\n    *   You must decode this content to get the actual Python source code.\n\n## 3. Workspace Preparation\n\nPrepare a clean workspace at `/home/user/qa_env`. \n\n*   **Warning**: This directory is often cluttered with debris from failed runs. Ensure it is completely clean before starting. Watch out for files with unusual permissions or types.\n*   **Deployment**: Place the decoded Python source code into `/home/user/qa_env/test_sample.py`.\n*   **Intermediate Checkpoint**: Before proceeding, you must calculate the **MD5 hash** of the *decoded* Python source content (the raw bytes of the file you just created). Save this hash, as it is required for the final report.\n\n## 4. Environment Construction\n\nCreate a standard Python virtual environment in `/home/user/qa_env/venv`.\n\n*   **Dependency Management**: You must install `pytest`. However, **do not hardcode the version**. \n    *   Read the required version from the project manifest file located at `/usr/local/share/qa_manifest.json`. The JSON schema is `{\"dependencies\": {\"pytest\": \"<version>\"}}`.\n    *   Install exactly that version into the virtual environment.\n\n## 5. Execution & Reporting\n\nExecute the tests using `pytest` in quiet mode. Then, generate the final report at the location identified in Step 1.\n\n### Report Format & Legacy Compliance\n\nOur auditing system runs on legacy Windows servers. Therefore, the output file must strictly adhere to the following binary formats:\n\n*   **Encoding**: The file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). UTF-8 is NOT accepted.\n*   **Line Endings**: Every line must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not Unix LF.\n\n**Content Structure** (3 lines total):\n1.  The first line of `pytest`'s output (usually a single dot `.` or similar status char).\n2.  The current **Session ID**. This is found in the environment variable `QA_SESSION_ID`. If that variable is missing, read it from `/etc/qa_session`.\n3.  The **MD5 hash** of the decoded `test_sample.py` calculated in Step 3.\n\n**Final Deliverable Checklist**:\n*   `/home/user/qa_env/test_sample.py` exists with correct decoded content.\n*   Virtual environment is active and has the correct pytest version.\n*   The log file exists at the configured path, has ISO-8859-1 encoding, CRLF line endings, and exactly 3 lines of content.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@c659e59d-31af-43df-a9a5-bdce4973f966:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
