  "analysis": "I have successfully retrieved the necessary configuration details. The configuration file `/home/user/.config/qa/settings.ini` specifies that the log file should be saved to `./qa_reports/audit_v1.log` under the `[Reporting]` section. The manifest file `/usr/local/share/qa_manifest.json` indicates that the required pytest version is `7.2.0`. The next step is to prepare the workspace and recover the source code.",
  "plan": "I will now prepare the workspace at `/home/user/qa_env`. This involves cleaning the directory and then recovering the most recently modified source archive from `/usr/local/src/archives`. I will extract the Python payload from the archive, decode it from Base64, and save it to `/home/user/qa_env/test_sample.py`. After that, I will calculate the MD5 hash of the decoded content for later use in the report.",
