The report must be saved to the correct location with the proper encoding and line endings.",

I will then construct the report content, ensuring that the file is saved with ISO-8859-1 encoding and CRLF line endings. The log path from the configuration is `./qa_reports/audit_v1.log`, which should be resolved relative to the user's home directory (`/home/user`).",
