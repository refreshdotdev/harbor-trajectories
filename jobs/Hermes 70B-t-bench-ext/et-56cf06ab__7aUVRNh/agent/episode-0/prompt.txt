You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a storage administrator who has just received daily disk-usage reports in JSON format. A draft JSON-Schema for the reports already exists on the machine so that you can check every incoming document for structural correctness before you build any statistics.

In addition, you have an inventory CSV file that defines the environment and cost associated with each host. You must incorporate this data into your report.

Directories and files that are already present:

1.  `/home/user/storage_audit/schema/disk_report.schema.json`
2.  `/home/user/storage_audit/raw_reports/` (contains various `*.json` files, some may be hidden or have uppercase extensions)
3.  `/home/user/storage_audit/inventory.csv`

What you have to do:

A.  Validation stage
    1.  Scan the directory `/home/user/storage_audit/raw_reports/` for files ending in `.json` (case-insensitive).
    2.  **Ignore** any file starting with a dot (`.`) (e.g., `.temp.json`).
    3.  Validate every candidate file against the schema.
    4.  Produce a validation log at `/home/user/storage_audit/logs/validation.log`
        *   Create the directory “logs” if it does not yet exist.
        *   The log must contain exactly one line per processed file with the following fixed format:
            `&lt;fileName&gt; : &lt;result&gt;[ : &lt;errorMessage&gt;]`
            where
            *   `&lt;fileName&gt;` = the base name of the file
            *   `&lt;result&gt;` can be:
                *   `OK` : File is valid JSON and matches the schema.
                *   `INVALID_JSON` : File content is not valid JSON syntax (parse error). No error message is appended for this case.
                *   `ERROR` : File is valid JSON but fails schema validation. Append the first error message (no colons allowed in message).
            Examples:
            `daily_storage01.json : OK`
            `corrupt_data.json : INVALID_JSON`
            `broken_schema.json : ERROR : required property "host" missing`

B.  Aggregation & reporting stage
    1.  Ignore every file that was not logged as `OK`.
    2.  Load `/home/user/storage_audit/inventory.csv`. It has the header `hostname,env,cost_per_gb`.
    3.  For every **valid** mount entry in the valid reports:
        *   Look up the report's `host` in the inventory.
        *   If found, use the corresponding `env` and `cost_per_gb`.
        *   If NOT found, default `env` to `"Unmanaged"` and `cost_per_gb` to `0`.
        *   Calculate:
            *   `freeGB` = `totalGB` – `usedGB`
            *   `usagePercent` = (`usedGB` / `totalGB`) × 100
            *   `monthlyCost` = `usedGB` × `cost_per_gb`
    4.  Build a summary file at `/home/user/storage_audit/summary/disk_usage_summary.json` following **exactly** this structure:

    ```json
    {
      "generatedAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "totals": {
        "totalGB": <number>,
        "usedGB": <number>,
        "freeGB": <number>,
        "usagePercent": <number>,
        "totalMonthlyCost": <number>
      },
      "mounts": [
        {
          "host": "<host>",
          "environment": "<env>",
          "mountPoint": "<mount>",
          "totalGB": <number>,
          "usedGB": <number>,
          "freeGB": <number>,
          "usagePercent": <number>,
          "monthlyCost": <number>
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    *   `totals.totalMonthlyCost` = sum of all `monthlyCost` values.
    *   `totals.usagePercent` = (`totals.usedGB` / `totals.totalGB`) × 100.
    *   The “mounts” array must be sorted **descending** by `usagePercent`.
    *   **Formatting Rule**: Every numeric literal in the document must have **either zero or exactly two** digits after the decimal point (e.g., `150`, `12.50`, `0.00`). Rounding should be done to two decimal places.

C.  Checksum
    1.  Calculate the SHA256 checksum of the final `disk_usage_summary.json` file.
    2.  Write the hexadecimal digest (and nothing else) to `/home/user/storage_audit/summary/checksum.sha256`.

D.  Final console output
    Print the absolute path of the summary JSON file.

Notes:
*   Do not modify the schema or the raw report files.
*   Permissions: Directories 755, Files 644.
*   Work entirely within `/home/user`.
