      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are working as an edge-computing engineer preparing a single-board IoT gateway for field deployment. Management has asked you to gather a precise \u201cpre-flight\u201d diagnostic bundle that must be archived on the device before it leaves the lab.\n\nA directory named `/home/user/iot_deployment` already exists and contains a file named `devices.txt`.\n*   This file contains a list of IPv4 addresses (one per line) that the gateway should be able to reach.\n*   **Note**: The file may contain comments (lines starting with `#`), blank lines, or leading/trailing whitespace. You must parse it to extract only valid non-empty IP addresses.\n*   DO NOT modify `devices.txt` \u2013 only read from it.\n\nA new sub-directory must be created: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics` (Create it if it does not already exist.)\n\nInside that `diagnostics` directory, generate THREE artefacts whose exact paths, filenames and formats must match the following specifications; **the automated tests will fail if there are spelling/formatting deviations.**\n\n#### Artefact 1: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/system_report.json`\n*   UTF-8 encoded, one single JSON object (no surrounding array, no trailing commas, pretty-printed with 2-space indents).\n*   Mandatory key layout:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2023-11-28T14:33:59Z>\",\n      \"hostname\": \"<output of the hostname command>\",\n      \"kernel\": \"<output of uname \u2011srv>\",\n      \"uptime_seconds\": <integer seconds since boot>,\n      \"load_average\": {\n        \"1min\": <float>,\n        \"5min\": <float>,\n        \"15min\": <float>\n      },\n      \"memory\": {\n        \"total_MB\": <int>,\n        \"used_MB\": <int>,\n        \"free_MB\": <int>\n      },\n      \"disk_usage\": [\n        {\n          \"mountpoint\": \"<string>\",\n          \"filesystem\": \"<string>\",\n          \"size_GB\": <float>,\n          \"used_GB\": <float>,\n          \"free_GB\": <float>,\n          \"percent_used\": <int>\n        }\n        ...

Numeric values are floats (GB) or int (percent).\n*   **`top_processes`**: List the top 5 processes by instantaneous CPU usage. **Exclude kernel threads** (processes where the `command` is surrounded by square brackets, e.g., `[kthreadd]`).\n*   **`reachable_devices`/`unreachable_devices`**: Decided by sending up to 3 ICMP echo requests (ping) to each valid IP from `devices.txt`; if at least one reply arrives the IP is \u201creachable\u201d.\n\n#### Artefact 2: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/ping_summary.csv`\n*   UTF-8 text, Unix line endings.\n*   First line is a header **exactly**: `ip,status,latency_ms`\n*   One subsequent line per valid IP found in `devices.txt`.\n*   **Sorting**: The rows must be sorted by **`latency_ms` in descending order** (highest latency first). Devices with status `unreachable` (latency `N/A`) must appear at the **bottom** of the list.\n*   `status` is either `reachable` or `unreachable` (lower-case).\n*   `latency_ms` is the average round-trip time across the successful replies rounded to 2 decimal places; use \u201cN/A\u201d (without quotes) if unreachable.\n\n#### Artefact 3: `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics/integrity.sha256`\n*   A text file containing the SHA256 checksums of `system_report.json` and `ping_summary.csv`.\n*   Format: Standard `sha256sum` output (hash followed by two spaces and the filename).\n*   **Constraint**: The filenames listed must be **relative** (e.g., `system_report.json`), not absolute paths.\n\n#### Permissions & Security\n*   All three files inside `diagnostics` must be **read-only** for everyone (mode `0444` or `r--r--r--`).\n*   The `diagnostics` directory itself must be mode `0755`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@70ff4054-76a2-4a97-bdb7-ae431b0ea8ec:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Create the `/home/user/iot_deployment/diagnostics` directory if it doesn't already exist.\n4. Generate `system_report.json` by collecting various system metrics (hostname, kernel, uptime, load average, memory usage, disk usage for ext4/xfs/overlay filesystems, top 5 non-kernel processes by CPU usage, open ports, and reachability results from the parsed IPs).\n5. Generate `ping_summary.csv` by testing each valid IP address, recording latency and reachability status, and formatting the output as a CSV with specific sorting and header requirements.\n6.

The next step is to gather disk usage information for filesystems of type ext4, xfs, or overlay.\nPlan: Use the `df` command to list mounted filesystems. Filter the output to include only filesystems of type ext4, xfs, or overlay. For each matching filesystem, extract the mountpoint, filesystem type, total size, used space, available space, and percentage of space used. Convert sizes from 1K blocks to gigabytes (1 GB = 1024 * 1024 KB).",
