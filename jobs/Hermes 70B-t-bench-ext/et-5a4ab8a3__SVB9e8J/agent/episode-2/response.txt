  "analysis": "The `devices.txt` file currently appears to be empty. According to the task description, this file is expected to contain a list of IPv4 addresses (one per line) that the gateway should be able to reach, but it may also contain comments, blank lines, or leading/trailing whitespace. Since the file is empty, the `reachable_devices` and `unreachable_devices` lists in the `system_report.json` will be empty, and the `ping_summary.csv` will have no rows for devices. I will proceed with generating the diagnostic artefacts based on the currently available (or lack of) device information.",
  "plan": "I will now start gathering all the system information required for the `system_report.json` artefact. This includes obtaining the current timestamp, hostname, kernel version, system uptime, load averages, memory usage, disk usage (for ext4, xfs, and overlay filesystems), the top 5 processes by CPU usage (excluding kernel threads), and a list of open ports. I will also begin by extracting any valid IP addresses from `devices.txt`, even if it is currently empty.",
