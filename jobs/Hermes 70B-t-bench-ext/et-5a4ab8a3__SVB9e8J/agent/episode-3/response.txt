  "analysis": "As expected, the command to extract valid IP addresses from the empty `devices.txt` file returned no output. This confirms that there are no devices listed, so the `reachable_devices` and `unreachable_devices` arrays in the final JSON report will be empty, and the ping summary will not contain any device entries. I will now proceed to gather all the system information required to construct the `system_report.json` artefact.",
  "plan": "I will now execute a series of commands to collect all necessary system metrics. This includes getting the current timestamp, hostname, kernel version, system uptime, load averages, memory usage, disk usage (for ext4, xfs, and overlay filesystems), the top 5 processes by CPU usage (excluding kernel threads), and a list of open ports. I will capture the output of each command for later processing into the JSON structure.",
