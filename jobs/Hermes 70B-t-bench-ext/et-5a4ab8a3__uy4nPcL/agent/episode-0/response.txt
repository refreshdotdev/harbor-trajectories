I need to create a `diagnostics` subdirectory within an existing `iot_deployment` directory and then populate it with three specific artefacts: a JSON system report, a CSV ping summary, and a SHA256 integrity file. The task requires me to parse an existing `devices.txt` file to extract valid IP addresses and then use them for reachability testing.",
  "plan": "I will begin by navigating to the `/home/user/iot_deployment` directory and then create the required `diagnostics` subdirectory if it does not already exist. Then I will gather all the necessary system information (hostname, kernel version, uptime, load averages, memory usage, disk usage for ext4/xfs/overlay, top processes by CPU, and open ports) into variables. I will also extract and validate IP addresses from `devices.txt` and perform ping tests on them. Once I have all the data, I will generate the three required artefacts in the correct format and with the specified permissions.",
