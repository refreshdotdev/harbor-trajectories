Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a FinOps analyst who has been asked to produce a concise cost summary from raw Google-Cloud-usage CSV logs that reside on the workstation. Everything must be done strictly from the Linux terminal, without installing third-party programs other than what is already available in a typical Debian/Ubuntu environment.\n\n1.  **Raw data location**\n    *   Folder: `/home/user/cloud_logs`\n    *   Files: The directory contains multiple files named `usage-YYYY-MM.csv`. You must process **all** such files found, sorted chronologically.\n\n2.  **CSV format and Data Quality**\n    *   Header is always the first line: `resource_id,service,usage_hours,cost`\n    *   **Warning:** The data is messy. Fields may contain leading/trailing whitespace which must be trimmed. The files may contain empty lines which must be ignored.\n    *   **Filtering:** Any row where the `service` name contains the text \"Trial\" (case-insensitive) must be strictly **excluded** from all calculations.\n\n3.  **Required calculations per month**\n    For each valid file (representing a month):\n    a.  **Subtotal:** The sum of the clean \"cost\" column.\n    b.  **Tax:** Calculate tax on the Subtotal using the rate defined in the environment variable `CORP_TAX_RATE` (e.g., `0.05` for 5%). If the variable is not set, default to `0.08`. Round the tax amount to exactly two decimal places.\n    c.  **Total:** Subtotal + Tax.\n    d.  **Service Breakdown:** Sum of costs per service (using the cleaned service name). Identify the 3 most expensive services, sorted descending.\n\n4.  **Expected output artefact**\n    Create the single text file `/home/user/cloud_logs/reports/cost_summary_report.txt`.\n    The directory `/home/user/cloud_logs/reports` does not exist yet; create it.\n\n    The file must follow this **exact** structure:\n    ```\n    CLOUD COST SUMMARY REPORT\n    == <Month_Name> <Year> ==\n    Subtotal: $<amount>\n    Tax: $<amount>\n    Total: $<amount>\n    Service Breakdown:\n      <Service-1>: $<cost>\n      <Service-2>: $<cost>\n      ... sorted by decreasing cost ...\n    Top 3 Services: <Service-A>, <Service-B>, <Service-C>\n\n    == <Next_Month_Name> <Year> ==\n    ... same structure ...\n\n    [CHECKSUM]: <sha256_hash>\n    ```\n    \n    **Footer Requirement:** The very last line of the file must be `[CHECKSUM]: <hash>`, where `<hash>` is the SHA-256 hexadecimal digest of all preceding content in the file (everything up to, but not including, the `[CHECKSUM]:` line). Ensure there is a blank line (empty line) between the last month's data and the checksum line.\n\n5.  **Additional requirements**\n    *   Do *not* modify, delete or rename the original CSV files.\n    *   All money values must be formatted to exactly two decimal places (e.g., `150.00`).\n    *   Service names in the output must be the trimmed versions from the CSV.\n    *   Date headers (e.g., \"September 2023\") must be derived from the filename `usage-YYYY-MM.csv`.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@6ea3f48e-da4b-4524-812f-cf2ed6237b6d:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
