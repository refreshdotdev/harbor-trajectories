  "analysis": "The AWK script `process_cloud_costs.awk` has been successfully created in the `/home/user/cloud_logs` directory. The script is designed to parse each CSV file, trim whitespace, filter out 'Trial' services, calculate subtotals, tax, total, and service breakdowns, formatting the output according to the specified requirements. The tax rate is hardcoded to 0.05 as determined from the environment variable. The next step is to make this script executable and then run it on all available CSV files, directing the output to the final report file.",
  "plan": "1. Make the `process_cloud_costs.awk` script executable using `chmod +x`. 2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all CSV files matching the pattern `usage-*.csv` in sorted chronological order (ascending by filename). 3. For each file, execute `awk -f process_cloud_costs.awk <filename>` and append its output to `/home/user/cloud_logs/reports/cost_summary_report.txt`. This ensures all monthly reports are concatenated into one file. 4. After all files are processed, append a final blank line to the report file, followed by the `[CHECKSUM]: <sha256_hash>` line. The hash will be calculated over the entire content of the report file up to that point.",
