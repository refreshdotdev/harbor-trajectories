  "analysis": "The `chmod +x process_cloud_costs.awk` command and the `for` loop to process CSV files were initiated. The `for` loop is intended to iterate through CSV files sorted by modification time (`ls -t`) and append their processed output to `reports/cost_summary_report.txt`. However, because the `for` loop command is complex and multi-line, it needs to be entered carefully into the terminal, typically by ensuring the shell recognizes the end of the command structure (e.g., the `done` keyword). The current output shows the commands were started. I will now execute the script processing and then generate the checksum.",
  "plan": "1. Ensure the `for` loop correctly executes `./process_cloud_costs.awk` on each CSV file (e.g., `usage-2023-09.csv`, `usage-2023-10.csv`, `usage-2023-11.csv`) and appends the output to `reports/cost_summary_report.txt`. 2. Verify the content of the generated report by displaying a few lines. 3. Add the required checksum line at the end of the report file. This involves calculating the SHA256 hash of all content in `reports/cost_summary_report.txt` up to (but not including) the checksum line itself, then appending the `[CHECKSUM]: <hash>` line. 4. Add a blank line before the checksum line as per requirements.",
