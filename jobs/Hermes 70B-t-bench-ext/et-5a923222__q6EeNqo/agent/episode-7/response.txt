  "analysis": "The `chmod +x process_cloud_costs.awk` command and the `for` loop to process CSV files were initiated. The `for` loop is intended to iterate through CSV files sorted by modification time (`ls -t`) and append their processed output to `reports/cost_summary_report.txt`. However, because the `for` loop command is complex and multi-line, it needs to be entered carefully into the terminal, typically by ensuring the shell recognizes the end of the command structure (e.g., the `done` keyword). The current output shows the commands were started. I will now execute the script processing and then generate the checksum.",
  "plan": "1. Execute the AWK script on all CSV files in chronological order. 2. Concatenate the output into the final report file. 3. Append a blank line before the checksum line as required. 4. Calculate the SHA256 hash of the report's content (excluding the future checksum line itself) and append it. 5. Verify the final structure of the report.",
