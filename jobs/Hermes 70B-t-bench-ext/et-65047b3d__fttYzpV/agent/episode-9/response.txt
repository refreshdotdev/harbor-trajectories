  "analysis": "Both required artifact files, `venv_info.log` and `manifest.json`, have been successfully created in the `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts` directory. The `venv_info.log` file contains the correct information, ISO-8859-1 encoding (with the micro symbol `µ` correctly handled as byte `0xB5`), and CRLF line endings. The `manifest.json` file correctly reports the byte size of `venv_info.log` as 129 and the line count as 4. All task requirements appear to have been met.",
  "plan": "The final step is to verify the overall setup and artifacts. I will list the contents of the `experiment_artifacts` directory to confirm both files are present. I will also double-check the permissions and location of the virtual environment. Since all tasks seem complete, I will indicate that the task is complete.",
