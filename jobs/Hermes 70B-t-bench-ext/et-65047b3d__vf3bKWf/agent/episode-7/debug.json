            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Environment Recovery Task\n\nYou are taking over a failed experiment run left by a previous engineer (\"Devin\") who was let go for failing to adhere to strict corporate compliance standards. Your goal is to clean up the environment, set up a compliant virtual environment, and generate the required artifact manifest for the Windows-based ingestion pipeline.\n\n## 1. Environment Cleanup\n\nThe target directory for this experiment is `/home/user/exp1`. \n\n**Warning:** The previous engineer left this directory in an inconsistent state (it might be a file, a symlink, or a locked directory). You must completely remove any existing item at that path before proceeding. Failure to start with a clean slate will cause the build verification to fail.\n\n## 2. Virtual Environment Setup\n\nCreate a new Python virtual environment inside `/home/user/exp1` named `.venv`. \n\n**Critical Configuration:**\n- You must use the builtin `venv` module.\n- The shell prompt for this environment must be strictly configured as `exp1_env`.\n- **Troubleshooting Hint:** The previous engineer was known to mess with global environment variables (specifically regarding `pip` configuration) in the shell startup files. If you encounter connectivity errors when using `pip`, check the environment variables and unset any that point to invalid configuration files.\n\n## 3. Package Installation\n\nActivate the environment and install `numpy` version `1.23.5`.\n\n## 4. Artifact Generation & Compliance Standards\n\nThis is where the previous engineer failed. Our downstream data ingestion pipeline runs on legacy Windows servers (Server 2012 R2). Therefore, all text artifacts generated in the `experiment_artifacts` subdirectory must adhere to the **\"Legacy Windows Compatibility\"** standard defined in the 2018 Operations Handbook.\n\n### The \"Legacy Windows Compatibility\" Standard:\n1.  **Encoding:** All text files must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All text files must use Windows-style Carriage Return + Line Feed (**CRLF**) line terminators (`\\r\\n`), not standard Linux LF (`\\n`).\n\n### Required Artifacts\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts`:\n\n#### A. `venv_info.log`\nThis file must contain exactly four lines in the following order:\n\n    PROJECT=Phoenix_\u00b51\n    VENV_PATH=/home/user/exp1/.venv\n    NUMPY_VERSION=1.23.5\n    NUMPY_INIT_MD5=<md5_checksum>\n\n**Details:**\n- The project code `Phoenix_\u00b51` contains a micro symbol. Ensure this is encoded correctly in ISO-8859-1 (byte value `0xB5`).\n- `<md5_checksum>` must be the **MD5 hash** of the `__init__.py` file belonging to the installed `numpy` package.\n- Ensure the file ends with a CRLF sequence.\n\n#### B. `manifest.json`\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, you must create a JSON manifest file (standard UTF-8 encoding is acceptable for this .json file only, but the content refers to the log file).\n\nContent:\n```json\n{\n  \"log_bytes\": <integer_size_in_bytes>,\n  \"log_lines\": 4\n}\n```\n**Constraint:** `log_bytes` must be the **exact file size** (in bytes) of the `venv_info.log` you generated. This creates a dependency: you must finalize the log file (with correct encoding and line endings) before measuring its size for the manifest.\n\nThe automated tests will verify:\n1.  The directory structure is correct.\n2.  The virtual environment works and `numpy` is installed.\n3.  The `venv_info.log` file is valid ISO-8859-1, uses CRLF, and contains the correct MD5 hash.\n4.  The `manifest.json` accurately reports the byte size of the log file.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@edcdcef6-b856-4748-b38e-b1349df6ffa8:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Environment Recovery Task\n\nYou are taking over a failed experiment run left by a previous engineer (\"Devin\") who was let go for failing to adhere to strict corporate compliance standards. Your goal is to clean up the environment, set up a compliant virtual environment, and generate the required artifact manifest for the Windows-based ingestion pipeline.\n\n## 1. Environment Cleanup\n\nThe target directory for this experiment is `/home/user/exp1`. \n\n**Warning:** The previous engineer left this directory in an inconsistent state (it might be a file, a symlink, or a locked directory). You must completely remove any existing item at that path before proceeding. Failure to start with a clean slate will cause the build verification to fail.\n\n## 2. Virtual Environment Setup\n\nCreate a new Python virtual environment inside `/home/user/exp1` named `.venv`. \n\n**Critical Configuration:**\n- You must use the builtin `venv` module.\n- The shell prompt for this environment must be strictly configured as `exp1_env`.\n- **Troubleshooting Hint:** The previous engineer was known to mess with global environment variables (specifically regarding `pip` configuration) in the shell startup files. If you encounter connectivity errors when using `pip`, check the environment variables and unset any that point to invalid configuration files.\n\n## 3. Package Installation\n\nActivate the environment and install `numpy` version `1.23.5`.\n\n## 4. Artifact Generation & Compliance Standards\n\nThis is where the previous engineer failed. Our downstream data ingestion pipeline runs on legacy Windows servers (Server 2012 R2). Therefore, all text artifacts generated in the `experiment_artifacts` subdirectory must adhere to the **\"Legacy Windows Compatibility\"** standard defined in the 2018 Operations Handbook.\n\n### The \"Legacy Windows Compatibility\" Standard:\n1.  **Encoding:** All text files must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All text files must use Windows-style Carriage Return + Line Feed (**CRLF**) line terminators (`\\r\\n`), not standard Linux LF (`\\n`).\n\n### Required Artifacts\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts`:\n\n#### A. `venv_info.log`\nThis file must contain exactly four lines in the following order:\n\n    PROJECT=Phoenix_\u00b51\n    VENV_PATH=/home/user/exp1/.venv\n    NUMPY_VERSION=1.23.5\n    NUMPY_INIT_MD5=<md5_checksum>\n\n**Details:**\n- The project code `Phoenix_\u00b51` contains a micro symbol. Ensure this is encoded correctly in ISO-8859-1 (byte value `0xB5`).\n- `<md5_checksum>` must be the **MD5 hash** of the `__init__.py` file belonging to the installed `numpy` package.\n- Ensure the file ends with a CRLF sequence.\n\n#### B. `manifest.json`\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, you must create a JSON manifest file (standard UTF-8 encoding is acceptable for this .json file only, but the content refers to the log file).\n\nContent:\n```json\n{\n  \"log_bytes\": <integer_size_in_bytes>,\n  \"log_lines\": 4\n}\n```\n**Constraint:** `log_bytes` must be the **exact file size** (in bytes) of the `venv_info.log` you generated. This creates a dependency: you must finalize the log file (with correct encoding and line endings) before measuring its size for the manifest.\n\nThe automated tests will verify:\n1.  The directory structure is correct.\n2.  The virtual environment works and `numpy` is installed.\n3.  The `venv_info.log` file is valid ISO-8859-1, uses CRLF, and contains the correct MD5 hash.\n4.  The `manifest.json` accurately reports the byte size of the log file.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@edcdcef6-b856-4748-b38e-b1349df6ffa8:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# MLOps Environment Recovery Task\n\nYou are taking over a failed experiment run left by a previous engineer (\"Devin\") who was let go for failing to adhere to strict corporate compliance standards. Your goal is to clean up the environment, set up a compliant virtual environment, and generate the required artifact manifest for the Windows-based ingestion pipeline.\n\n## 1. Environment Cleanup\n\nThe target directory for this experiment is `/home/user/exp1`. \n\n**Warning:** The previous engineer left this directory in an inconsistent state (it might be a file, a symlink, or a locked directory). You must completely remove any existing item at that path before proceeding. Failure to start with a clean slate will cause the build verification to fail.\n\n## 2. Virtual Environment Setup\n\nCreate a new Python virtual environment inside `/home/user/exp1` named `.venv`. \n\n**Critical Configuration:**\n- You must use the builtin `venv` module.\n- The shell prompt for this environment must be strictly configured as `exp1_env`.\n- **Troubleshooting Hint:** The previous engineer was known to mess with global environment variables (specifically regarding `pip` configuration) in the shell startup files. If you encounter connectivity errors when using `pip`, check the environment variables and unset any that point to invalid configuration files.\n\n## 3. Package Installation\n\nActivate the environment and install `numpy` version `1.23.5`.\n\n## 4. Artifact Generation & Compliance Standards\n\nThis is where the previous engineer failed. Our downstream data ingestion pipeline runs on legacy Windows servers (Server 2012 R2). Therefore, all text artifacts generated in the `experiment_artifacts` subdirectory must adhere to the **\"Legacy Windows Compatibility\"** standard defined in the 2018 Operations Handbook.\n\n### The \"Legacy Windows Compatibility\" Standard:\n1.  **Encoding:** All text files must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Do NOT use UTF-8.\n2.  **Line Endings:** All text files must use Windows-style Carriage Return + Line Feed (**CRLF**) line terminators (`\\r\\n`), not standard Linux LF (`\\n`).\n\n### Required Artifacts\n\nYou must generate two files in `/home/user/exp1/experiment_artifacts`:\n\n#### A. `venv_info.log`\nThis file must contain exactly four lines in the following order:\n\n    PROJECT=Phoenix_\u00b51\n    VENV_PATH=/home/user/exp1/.venv\n    NUMPY_VERSION=1.23.5\n    NUMPY_INIT_MD5=<md5_checksum>\n\n**Details:**\n- The project code `Phoenix_\u00b51` contains a micro symbol. Ensure this is encoded correctly in ISO-8859-1 (byte value `0xB5`).\n- `<md5_checksum>` must be the **MD5 hash** of the `__init__.py` file belonging to the installed `numpy` package.\n- Ensure the file ends with a CRLF sequence.\n\n#### B. `manifest.json`\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, you must create a JSON manifest file (standard UTF-8 encoding is acceptable for this .json file only, but the content refers to the log file).\n\nContent:\n```json\n{\n  \"log_bytes\": <integer_size_in_bytes>,\n  \"log_lines\": 4\n}\n```\n**Constraint:** `log_bytes` must be the **exact file size** (in bytes) of the `venv_info.log` you generated. This creates a dependency: you must finalize the log file (with correct encoding and line endings) before measuring its size for the manifest.\n\nThe automated tests will verify:\n1.  The directory structure is correct.\n2.  The virtual environment works and `numpy` is installed.\n3.  The `venv_info.log` file is valid ISO-8859-1, uses CRLF, and contains the correct MD5 hash.\n4.  The `manifest.json` accurately reports the byte size of the log file.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@edcdcef6-b856-4748-b38e-b1349df6ffa8:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
