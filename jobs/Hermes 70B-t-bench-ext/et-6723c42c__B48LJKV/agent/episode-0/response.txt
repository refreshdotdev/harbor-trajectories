  "plan": "First, I will extract the Daily Badge ID from `/home/user/app/config/system_settings.conf`. Then I'll search the `/home/user/app/logs` directory for files matching the criteria: size > 512 bytes, modified within last 7 days, containing `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`, and not in `test`, `mock`, or `staging` directories. I'll calculate HMAC-SHA256 signatures for each valid file using the badge ID as the key. Finally, I'll create a gzipped tarball archive in `/home/user/diag` and a sorted JSON manifest.",
