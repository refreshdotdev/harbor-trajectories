You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a lead forensic analyst at a legacy data center. You have received an urgent directive from the CISO regarding a potential security breach involving the “Omega” service layer. 

We need a forensic bundle immediately. Do not ask for clarifications; the CISO is offline.

### Context & Protocol

The environment is a mess of legacy and modern systems. Logs are scattered across `/home/user/app/logs`. You are looking for evidence of the “Omega” breach. The specific signature of the breach is the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]` appearing on any line within the log. 

However, we cannot simply dump every file. We are subject to strict data minimization policies (DMP-2024). This means you must only archive files that contain that specific signature. Furthermore, to prove chain-of-custody, every file entry in your manifest must be cryptographically signed using the current **Daily Badge ID**. You will find the Daily Badge ID located inside the file `/home/user/app/config/system_settings.conf`. It is the value associated with the key `current_badge_id` (ignore the comments in that file).

### Environment State

1.  **Source:** `/home/user/app/logs` (recursive).
2.  **Destination:** `/home/user/diag` (already exists).
3.  **Filenames:** The developers were careless. Some filenames contain spaces, newlines, or non-ASCII characters. Your script must handle these robustly.
4.  **Encodings:** Most logs are UTF-8, but some legacy subsystems write in ISO-8859-1. If you encounter a file that is not valid UTF-8, you must still process it, but treat it as binary for the purpose of checksums.

### Deliverables

You must produce exactly two artifacts in `/home/user/diag`.

#### 1. The Evidence Archive

*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/forensic_bundle.tar.gz`
*   **Format:** Gzipped tarball.
*   **Structure:** Files must be stored with their relative paths from the search root (e.g., if the file is `/home/user/app/logs/server/a.log`, the tar member should be `server/a.log`).
*   **Inclusion Criteria:**
    *   File size must be strictly greater than 512 bytes (smaller files are heartbeats).
    *   Modification time: Must be within the last 7 days.
    *   **Content:** Must contain the string `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`.
    *   **Exclusion:** Do *not* include any files located inside directories named `test`, `mock`, or `staging` (case-insensitive), even if they match other criteria. These are red herrings.

#### 2. The Chain-of-Custody Manifest

*   **Path:** `/home/user/diag/custody_manifest.json`
*   **Format:** A valid JSON array of objects.
*   **Sorting:** The array must be sorted by the `filepath` field using standard byte-value sorting (i.e., `LC_COLLATE=C`).
*   **Object Schema:**
    ```json
    {
      "filepath": "absolute/path/to/file",
      "size": <integer_bytes>,
      "signature": "<HMAC-SHA256_HEX>"
    }
    ```
*   **Signature Calculation:** The `signature` field is an HMAC-SHA256 hash. 
    *   **Key:** The **Daily Badge ID** found in the config file (trim whitespace).
    *   **Message:** The raw binary content of the file.

### Constraints

*   You may use Python 3 or standard GNU utilities.
*   Do not install new packages.
*   The JSON manifest must be compact (no indentation/pretty-printing) to save space, occupying a single line or minimal lines, though valid JSON structure is the priority.
*   **Warning:** The directory `/home/user/app/logs/legacy` contains a trap file with a newline character in its filename. If your script crashes or produces a malformed manifest because of this, you fail.
