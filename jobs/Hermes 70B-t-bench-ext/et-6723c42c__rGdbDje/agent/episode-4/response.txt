Now I need to search for log files in `/home/user/app/logs` that contain `[SECURITY-AUDIT-FAIL]`, are >512 bytes, modified within 7 days, and not in `test`/`mock`/`staging` directories. I'll use a robust find command with null-delimited output to handle special filenames.",
  "plan": "I will use `find` to search for files, then process them in a while-read loop to check for the security signature, file size, modification time, and exclusion directories. I'll collect the qualifying files and store them in the staging area with their relative paths. After collecting all files, I'll create the tar archive and manifest.",
