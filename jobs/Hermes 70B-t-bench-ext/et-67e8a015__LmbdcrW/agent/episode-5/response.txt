  "analysis": "All required tasks have been completed successfully. The `fr_FR` directory now contains the `messages.po` file with updated headers and the `checksum.sha256` file. The `update.log` file has been appended with the correct entry, and the timestamp matches the one in the `messages.po` header. However, the `fr_FR` directory also contains `messages.po.bak`, which was a temporary backup file created during the process. The requirement states it must contain *only* `messages.po` and `checksum.sha256`.",
  "plan": "The final step is to remove the backup file `messages.po.bak` from the `fr_FR` directory to meet the cleanliness requirement. After this, the task will be fully complete according to all specifications.",
