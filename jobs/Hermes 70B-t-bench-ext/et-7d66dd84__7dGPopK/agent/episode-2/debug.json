As the release engineer, you must execute the deployment preparation protocol. The project is located at `/home/user/projects/website`.\n\n## 1. System Context & Pre-flight Checks\n\nThe environment contains a legacy configuration system used by older Windows based parsers. \n- The file `/home/user/projects/website/config.xml` is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It contains special characters (like copyright symbols) that must be preserved. \n- The file `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md` uses **CRLF (Windows)** line endings. This format is strictly enforced by the documentation generator pipeline.\n\n## 2. Release Tasks\n\nPerform the following operations in the terminal. The order of operations is critical for generating the audit trail correctly.\n\n### A. Snapshot & Backup\nBefore modifying any files, you must create a compressed backup of the `package.json` file.\n1. Create a directory `/home/user/projects/website/backups`.\n2. Compress the *original* `package.json` into a gzip file named `package.json.bak.gz` inside that directory.\n\n### B. Security Token Generation\nLegacy auditing requires a \"Release Token\" derived from the *previous* state of the changelog.\n1. Read the very first line of `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md` (e.g., the header for version 1.2.3).\n2. Strip any trailing newline characters from that line.\n3. Calculate the **MD5 hash** of that stripped line.\n4. Concatenate the resulting MD5 hex string with the new version number (`1.3.0`).\n5. **Base64 encode** the combined string.\n   *(Save this token; you will need it for the manifest file in step E)*.\n\n### C. Version Bump\nUpdate the project version from `1.2.3` to `1.3.0` in the following files:\n\n1. `/home/user/projects/website/package.json`: Update the `version` field.\n2. `/home/user/projects/website/config.xml`: Update the content of the `<Version>` tag. \n   *Warning*: Ensure you save this file back as **ISO-8859-1**. If you accidentally convert it to UTF-8, the special characters will break the build server.\n\n### D. Changelog Update\nPrepend the new 1.3.0 section to `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md`. \n\n**Content to prepend:**\n```markdown\n## [1.3.0] - 2024-06-01\n### Added\n- Implemented blog post search feature.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The new section must appear at the top.\n- There must be exactly one blank line between the new section and the old 1.2.3 header.\n- **Crucial**: The entire file must consist of **CRLF** line endings. Do not mix LF and CRLF.\n\n### E. Manifest Generation\nGenerate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/projects/website/release_manifest.json`. \n\nThe file must be valid JSON with an indentation of **4 spaces** and contain exactly these keys:\n\n- `\"release_token\"`: The token you calculated in Step B.\n- `\"package_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `package.json`.\n- `\"config_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `config.xml`.\n- `\"builder\"`: The value of the environment variable `BUILD_USER`. \n  *Note*: If `BUILD_USER` is not set in the current shell, read the fallback username from the configuration file at `/home/user/.build_config` (format is `key=value`).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\nWhen you are finished, the automated verification system will check:\n1. `backups/package.json.bak.gz` exists and decompresses to the original content.\n2. `package.json` and `config.xml` are updated to 1.3.0.\n3. `config.xml` is still ISO-8859-1.\n4. `CHANGELOG.md` has the new section and is strictly CRLF.\n5. `release_manifest.json` exists, is valid JSON (4-space indent), and contains the correct calculated token, hashes, and builder name.\n\nYou do not need to commit to git.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@04143f2a-8a4b-41b6-9490-92b4c8ccb9b5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Changelog Update\nPrepend the new 1.3.0 section to `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md`. \n\n**Content to prepend:**\n```markdown\n## [1.3.0] - 2024-06-01\n### Added\n- Implemented blog post search feature.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The new section must appear at the top.\n- There must be exactly one blank line between the new section and the old 1.2.3 header.\n- **Crucial**: The entire file must consist of **CRLF** line endings. Do not mix LF and CRLF.\n\n### E. Manifest Generation\nGenerate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/projects/website/release_manifest.json`. \n\nThe file must be valid JSON with an indentation of **4 spaces** and contain exactly these keys:\n\n- `\"release_token\"`: The token you calculated in Step B.\n- `\"package_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `package.json`.\n- `\"config_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `config.xml`.\n- `\"builder\"`: The value of the environment variable `BUILD_USER`. \n  *Note*: If `BUILD_USER` is not set in the current shell, read the fallback username from the configuration file at `/home/user/.build_config` (format is `key=value`).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\nWhen you are finished, the automated verification system will check:\n1. `backups/package.json.bak.gz` exists and decompresses to the original content.\n2. `package.json` and `config.xml` are updated to 1.3.0.\n3. `config.xml` is still ISO-8859-1.\n4. `CHANGELOG.md` has the new section and is strictly CRLF.\n5. `release_manifest.json` exists, is valid JSON (4-space indent), and contains the correct calculated token, hashes, and builder name.\n\nYou do not need to commit to git.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@04143f2a-8a4b-41b6-9490-92b4c8ccb9b5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Release Protocol v2.4\n\nYour software team has finalized the feature set for the 1.3.0 release. As the release engineer, you must execute the deployment preparation protocol. The project is located at `/home/user/projects/website`.\n\n## 1. System Context & Pre-flight Checks\n\nThe environment contains a legacy configuration system used by older Windows based parsers. \n- The file `/home/user/projects/website/config.xml` is encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It contains special characters (like copyright symbols) that must be preserved. \n- The file `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md` uses **CRLF (Windows)** line endings. This format is strictly enforced by the documentation generator pipeline.\n\n## 2. Release Tasks\n\nPerform the following operations in the terminal. The order of operations is critical for generating the audit trail correctly.\n\n### A. Snapshot & Backup\nBefore modifying any files, you must create a compressed backup of the `package.json` file.\n1. Create a directory `/home/user/projects/website/backups`.\n2. Compress the *original* `package.json` into a gzip file named `package.json.bak.gz` inside that directory.\n\n### B. Security Token Generation\nLegacy auditing requires a \"Release Token\" derived from the *previous* state of the changelog.\n1. Read the very first line of `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md` (e.g., the header for version 1.2.3).\n2. Strip any trailing newline characters from that line.\n3. Calculate the **MD5 hash** of that stripped line.\n4. Concatenate the resulting MD5 hex string with the new version number (`1.3.0`).\n5. **Base64 encode** the combined string.\n   *(Save this token; you will need it for the manifest file in step E)*.\n\n### C. Version Bump\nUpdate the project version from `1.2.3` to `1.3.0` in the following files:\n\n1. `/home/user/projects/website/package.json`: Update the `version` field.\n2. `/home/user/projects/website/config.xml`: Update the content of the `<Version>` tag. \n   *Warning*: Ensure you save this file back as **ISO-8859-1**. If you accidentally convert it to UTF-8, the special characters will break the build server.\n\n### D. Changelog Update\nPrepend the new 1.3.0 section to `/home/user/projects/website/CHANGELOG.md`. \n\n**Content to prepend:**\n```markdown\n## [1.3.0] - 2024-06-01\n### Added\n- Implemented blog post search feature.\n\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The new section must appear at the top.\n- There must be exactly one blank line between the new section and the old 1.2.3 header.\n- **Crucial**: The entire file must consist of **CRLF** line endings. Do not mix LF and CRLF.\n\n### E. Manifest Generation\nGenerate a JSON manifest file at `/home/user/projects/website/release_manifest.json`. \n\nThe file must be valid JSON with an indentation of **4 spaces** and contain exactly these keys:\n\n- `\"release_token\"`: The token you calculated in Step B.\n- `\"package_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `package.json`.\n- `\"config_sha256\"`: The SHA256 hash of the *updated* `config.xml`.\n- `\"builder\"`: The value of the environment variable `BUILD_USER`. \n  *Note*: If `BUILD_USER` is not set in the current shell, read the fallback username from the configuration file at `/home/user/.build_config` (format is `key=value`).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\nWhen you are finished, the automated verification system will check:\n1. `backups/package.json.bak.gz` exists and decompresses to the original content.\n2. `package.json` and `config.xml` are updated to 1.3.0.\n3. `config.xml` is still ISO-8859-1.\n4. `CHANGELOG.md` has the new section and is strictly CRLF.\n5. `release_manifest.json` exists, is valid JSON (4-space indent), and contains the correct calculated token, hashes, and builder name.\n\nYou do not need to commit to git.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@04143f2a-8a4b-41b6-9490-92b4c8ccb9b5:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
