I see there's an issue with the changelog formatting - it's showing $ signs indicating LF line endings instead of CRLF, and the manifest JSON is missing the required 4-space indentation. Let me fix these issues before completing the task.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The final verification revealed two issues: 1) The CHANGELOG.md file has LF line endings instead of the required CRLF, and 2) The release_manifest.json file is missing the required 4-space indentation. I need to fix these before marking the task as complete.",
  "plan": "I will convert CHANGELOG.md to CRLF line endings and recreate the release_manifest.json file with proper 4-space indentation. Then I'll run a final verification to ensure all deliverables meet the protocol specifications.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "sed -i 's/$/\\r/' CHANGELOG.md\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "rm release_manifest.json\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cat > release_manifest.json << 'EOF'\n{\n    \"release_token\": \"$(cat /tmp/release_token.txt)\",\n    \"package_sha256\": \"$(cut -d' ' -f1 /tmp/package_sha256.txt)\",\n    \"config_sha256\": \"$(cut -d' ' -f1 /tmp/config_sha256.txt)\",\n    \"builder\": \"${BUILD_USER}\"\n}\nEOF\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": false
}
