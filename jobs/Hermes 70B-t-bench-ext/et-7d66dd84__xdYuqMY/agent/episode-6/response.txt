Great! The installation completed successfully and the version updates have been applied. Now I need to verify the changes and proceed with the changelog update.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The package.json and config.xml files have been updated to version 1.3.0. I need to verify these updates and then proceed with Step D (Changelog Update) by adding the new release section to CHANGELOG.md while maintaining the strict CRLF line ending requirement.",
  "plan": "I will verify the updated version numbers, then add the new 1.3.0 section to the top of CHANGELOG.md. I'll ensure there's exactly one blank line between the new section and the old 1.2.3 header, and verify that the file maintains CRLF line endings throughout.",
