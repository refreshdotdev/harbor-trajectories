I see there are extra blank lines in the CHANGELOG.md from the here-document creation. I need to clean this up to match the exact specification of having exactly one blank line between sections.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The version updates in package.json and config.xml are verified. The CHANGELOG.md has been updated with the new 1.3.0 section, but contains extra blank lines from the here-document creation process. I need to clean this up to meet the exact specification of having exactly one blank line between sections while maintaining CRLF line endings.",
  "plan": "I will use sed to remove the extra blank lines while preserving the CRLF line endings. Then I'll proceed with Step E (Manifest Generation) by creating the release_manifest.json file with the calculated token, file hashes, and builder information.",

    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "sed -i '1s/^/\\n/' CHANGELOG.md\n",
