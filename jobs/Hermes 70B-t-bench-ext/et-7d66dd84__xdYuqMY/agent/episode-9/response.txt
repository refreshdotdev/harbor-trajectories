I see that the variables in the manifest file didn't expand properly because the here-document doesn't process shell variables by default. Let me fix this and also verify all the deliverables.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The release_manifest.json file was created but the variables didn't expand because the here-document doesn't process shell variables by default. I need to recreate it with proper variable expansion. After fixing this, I should verify all the deliverables to ensure they meet the protocol requirements.",
  "plan": "I will recreate the release_manifest.json file using a different approach that allows variable expansion. Then I'll run verification commands to check: backup file existence, version numbers, file encodings, changelog format, and manifest content.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "rm release_manifest.json\n",
