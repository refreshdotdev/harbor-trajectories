  "analysis": "The TBD replacement for setup.md was successful! The standalone 'URGENT TBD' on line 9 has been replaced with 'TO BE DETERMINED', and the change has been recorded in the change log. Now I need to add the confidential footer to this file since it contains 'confidential' content. Then I'll process usage.md similarly - first verifying it has a proper standalone TBD line, then replacing it, and finally checking for confidential content.",
  "plan": "I'll append two newline characters followed by the confidential footer line to setup.md. Then I'll check usage.md to find its standalone TBD line, capture the original line, replace 'TBD' with 'To Be Determined' (no 'URGENT' context), and log the change. I'll also check if usage.md needs a confidential footer (it shouldn't based on my current content).",
