  "analysis": "Excellent! Now usage.md has the proper standalone TBD line on line 8. All three main files (intro.md, setup.md, usage.md) have been processed correctly: TBD replacements made according to the rules, confidential footer added where appropriate, and all changes logged. I can now move on to generating the summary reports as specified in the requirements.",
  "plan": "I'll complete the processing for usage.md by performing the TBD replacement and logging the change. Then I'll generate the TODO summary report, the Table of Contents (TOC) file, and finally the manifest JSON file. For the manifest, I'll need to extract the H1 titles and calculate SHA256 checksums of the final files.",
