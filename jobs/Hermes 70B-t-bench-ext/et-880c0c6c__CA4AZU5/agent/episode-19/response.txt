The objects should be comma-separated and sorted alphabetically by filename.",
  "plan": "I'll construct JSON objects for each file using shell commands. For each file, I'll extract the title using sed, calculate the SHA256 hash using sha256sum, and format the data as JSON. I'll add each object to the manifest.json array, making sure to include commas between objects. Finally, I'll close the array and verify the JSON structure."
