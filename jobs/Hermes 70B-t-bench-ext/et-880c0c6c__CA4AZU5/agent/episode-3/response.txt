  "analysis": "The draft files have been successfully created with content that matches the specifications. Each file has a H1 heading, paragraphs, TODO lines, and a standalone TBD line. Setup.md contains 'URGENT TBD' to test that specific replacement case, and also contains 'confidential' text to test the footer injection requirement. The backups were created from the original empty files, which is correct since backups should be made before any modifications.",
  "plan": "Now I need to process each file according to the requirements. For each file, I'll perform the TBD replacement (with different handling for the URGENT case), then check for 'confidential' content and append the appropriate footer if needed. As I make changes, I'll capture the original and new lines for the change log. I'll also count TODO lines for the summary report.",
