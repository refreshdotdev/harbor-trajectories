Since the files are relatively small, I can process them one by one, making the required changes and capturing the before/after states for the change log.",
  "plan": "I'll begin with intro.md:
1. Identify the standalone TBD line
2. Since it doesn't contain 'URGENT', replace it with 'To Be Determined'
3. Check for 'confidential' content (there is none, so no footer needed)
4. Record the change in the change log
I'll repeat this process for setup.md and usage.md, making sure to handle the 'URGENT TBD' case differently in setup.md.",
