  "analysis": "Good! Now intro.md has a proper standalone TBD line on line 9. I can see the file structure is preserved with the H1 heading, paragraphs, TODO line, and the standalone TBD. I'm ready to perform the TBD replacement on this file. Since this TBD doesn't contain 'URGENT', it should be replaced with 'To Be Determined'. After making the change, I'll record it in the change log.",
  "plan": "I will use sed to replace the standalone TBD line with 'To Be Determined'. I'll capture the original line and the new line to add to the change log. Then I'll check if the file contains 'confidential' (it doesn't), so no footer injection is needed for this file. I'll repeat this process for the other files, making sure to handle setup.md's 'URGENT TBD' case differently.",
