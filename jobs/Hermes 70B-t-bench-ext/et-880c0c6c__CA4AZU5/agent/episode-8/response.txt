  "analysis": "The TBD replacement for intro.md was successful! The standalone 'TBD' on line 9 has been replaced with 'To Be Determined', and the change has been recorded in the change log. Since intro.md doesn't contain 'confidential', no footer was added. Now I need to verify setup.md has the proper standalone TBD line (specifically the 'URGENT TBD' case I intended), and process it accordingly.",
  "plan": "I'll check setup.md to find its standalone TBD line (which should be the line with 'URGENT TBD'). I'll capture the original line, replace 'TBD' with 'TO BE DETERMINED' (all caps because of the 'URGENT' context), and log the change. Then I'll check for 'confidential' content and add the appropriate footer since this file should contain that text.",
