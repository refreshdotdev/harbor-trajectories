You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are assisting a senior technical-writer who is tidying up some draft
Markdown documentation stored in the directory
“/home/user/docs/drafts”.
The writer would like several consolidated artefacts placed in
“/home/user/docs/reports” and a backup of the originals in
“/home/user/docs/backups”.

Initial material you will find in “/home/user/docs/drafts/”:
    • intro.md
    • setup.md
    • usage.md
    • _notes.md (and possibly others)

Each Markdown file contains:
    • Exactly one top-level “H1” heading (a single “# ” followed by the
      title).
    • Several free-form paragraphs.
    • One or more lines containing the string “TODO”.
    • Exactly one line containing the *stand-alone* word “TBD”.
      (The word “TBD” never shares a line with any other “TBD”.)

The writer wants the following clean-up and reporting work:

0.  Exclusion Rules
    Ignore any file in the drafts directory whose name starts with an
    underscore (`_`). These files must not be modified, backed up, or
    referenced in any report.

1.  Backups
    Before modifying any file, create a copy in “/home/user/docs/backups”.
    • The backup filename must be the original filename with “.bak” appended
      (e.g., “intro.md.bak”).
    • You must preserve the original file’s timestamps and permissions
      (e.g., use `cp -p`).

2.  Text Replacement
    Modify the valid draft files in place:
    • If a line containing the stand-alone word “TBD” also contains the
      string “URGENT” (case-sensitive), replace “TBD” with
      “TO BE DETERMINED” (all caps).
    • Otherwise, replace the stand-alone word “TBD” with “To Be Determined”.
    • No other words on the line should be changed.

3.  Footer Injection
    Check the content of each file (before or during processing):
    • If the file contains the word “confidential” (case-insensitive) anywhere,
      append exactly two newline characters followed by the line:
      `> This document is confidential.`
      to the end of the file.

4.  TODO summary file
    Create “/home/user/docs/reports/todo_summary.txt”:
        TODO Summary Report

        <filename>: <count>
        <filename>: <count>
        ...
    Requirements:
        • List every processed filename, sorted alphabetically.
        • <count> is the number of lines containing “TODO” in the final file.

5.  Table-of-Contents (TOC) file
    Create “/home/user/docs/reports/toc.md”:
        - [<H1 Title>](/docs/<filename>)
        ...
    Requirements:
        • One line per processed file, sorted alphabetically by filename.

6.  Change log
    Produce “/home/user/docs/reports/change_log.log”:
        Change Log
        YYYY-MM-DD <filename>: "<original line>" -> "<new line>"
        ...
    Requirements:
        • Document the single “TBD” replacement for each processed file.
        • Sorted alphabetically by filename.
        • Preserve exact spacing/content of original and new lines.

7.  Manifest JSON
    Create “/home/user/docs/reports/manifest.json”.
    This file must contain a JSON array of objects, one for each processed
    file, sorted by filename. Each object must have:
        • "filename": The base filename (e.g., "intro.md")
        • "title": The H1 title extracted from the file.
        • "hash": The SHA256 checksum of the *final* file content.

Directory constraints & permissions:
    • Create directories if they do not exist.
    • All created files/directories must be writable by the current user.
    • Report files must be world-readable.

Verification hints:
    • Checksums in manifest.json must match the final file state on disk.
    • Backups must match the state of files *before* any modification.
    • Files starting with `_` must be completely ignored.
