  "analysis": "The grep commands confirm that intro.md contains no stand-alone TBD instances (0 matches) and no confidential content. Since the file is empty, I will not perform any text replacements or footer injections. I'll count the TODOs (which will be 0), then move on to the next file. I'll also need to handle the missing H1 title in the manifest and TOC files appropriately.",
  "plan": "I will now count TODOs in intro.md, then create the temporary working file structure. After processing intro.md, I'll move on to setup.md and usage.md, repeating the same backup, extraction, replacement, and reporting steps for each valid file."
