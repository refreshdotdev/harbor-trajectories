Your task is to generate a strict migration manifest for the audit team. This is not a standard Linux task; you are bridging a gap between an old Windows-based mainframe export and a legacy auditing system.\n\n### The Environment\n\nThe environment contains several files, but you must be careful to use the correct ones.\n\n1.  **Source Inventory:** The location of the authoritative inventory file is stored in the environment variable `$LEGACY_INVENTORY`. \n    *   *Warning:* Do not use any other CSV files you might find in the directory tree; they are stale exports.\n    *   *Context:* This file comes from a Windows mainframe. It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.\n    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.\n\n2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.\n\n#### 1. The Migration Plan (`migration_plan.tsv`)\n\nYou must generate a Tab-Separated Values file. \n\n**Content Requirements:**\n*   **Columns:** Exactly two columns: `ServiceName` and `TargetFQDN`.\n*   **Filtering:** \n    *   Ignore comment lines (lines starting with `#` after decoding).\n    *   The source CSV has a column named `Status`. You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.\n    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.\n    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.\n*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.\n\n**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**\n*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.\n*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).\n\n#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nInstead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source_file\": \"<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>\",\n  \"record_count\": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,\n  \"output_md5\": \"<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.\n\n#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)\n\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.\n*   It must contain exactly one line.\n*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.\n*   Example: `452 bytes generated`\n\n### Summary of Constraints\n*   Do not modify the source files.\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).\n*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@64f3511b-3154-4867-a464-dbff3c8f6363:/home/user/cloud#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You must **exclude** any rows where `Status` is exactly `Decom` or `Pending`.\n    *   You must **exclude** rows where the `NewServer` column is empty or contains only whitespace.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `ServiceName`: Convert to all **lowercase**.\n    *   `TargetFQDN`: Construct this by taking the `NewServer` value, stripping any Zero Width Spaces, and appending the domain suffix from the config file.\n*   **Sorting:** The output must be sorted alphabetically by `ServiceName`.\n\n**Technical/Binary Requirements (CRITICAL):**\n*   **Encoding:** The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. It must NOT be UTF-8.\n*   **Line Endings:** Every line (including the header and the last line) must end with **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`), not just LF. This is required for the Windows-based consumer.\n*   **Header:** The first line must be `ServiceName\\tTargetFQDN` (separated by a tab, ending in CRLF).\n\n#### 2. The Manifest (`manifest.json`)\n\nInstead of a simple checksum, you must generate a JSON file named `/home/user/cloud/output/manifest.json`. This file must be valid JSON and contain exactly this structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source_file\": \"<value of $LEGACY_INVENTORY>\",\n  \"record_count\": <integer count of data rows in the TSV, excluding header>,\n  \"output_md5\": \"<MD5 hex digest of the final migration_plan.tsv>\"\n}\n```\n\n*Note:* The MD5 hash must be calculated against the *final* ISO-8859-1, CRLF-terminated file.\n\n#### 3. The Audit Log (`audit.log`)\n\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/cloud/output/audit.log`.\n*   It must contain exactly one line.\n*   The line must list the **size in bytes** of the final `migration_plan.tsv` file, followed by a space, followed by the text `bytes generated`.\n*   Example: `452 bytes generated`\n\n### Summary of Constraints\n*   Do not modify the source files.\n*   Use standard Linux tools (Python, Bash, Awk, Sed, Iconv, etc.).\n*   Ensure strict adherence to the encoding and line-ending requirements; the automated validator mimics a legacy system that will crash if fed UTF-8 or Unix LFs.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@64f3511b-3154-4867-a464-dbff3c8f6363:/home/user/cloud#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are the lead engineer for the \"Phoenix\" Legacy Migration Project.

It is encoded in **UTF-16LE** and starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). It uses CRLF line endings.\n    *   *Data Quality:* The mainframe export is notorious for inserting invisible **Zero Width Spaces (U+200B)** into the `NewServer` field. These must be removed.\n\n2.  **Configuration:** You need to append a domain suffix to the server names. This suffix is found in a hidden file at `/home/user/cloud/.config` (it is a single line of text).\n\n### Deliverables\n\nYou must produce your artifacts in a new directory: `/home/user/cloud/output`.\n\n#### 1.

The task also warned against using stale exports. While `inventory.csv` is the only CSV available, its characteristics deviate from the described mainframe export.

The transformation rules for `ServiceName` (to lowercase) and `TargetFQDN` (using `NewServer`, domain suffix `.internal.corp`, and stripping Zero Width Spaces) will still apply. I'll need to interpret the filtering rules: since there's no `Status` column, I'll assume no rows need to be excluded based on status values like `Decom` or `Pending` unless these states are implicitly derivable, which seems unlikely.
