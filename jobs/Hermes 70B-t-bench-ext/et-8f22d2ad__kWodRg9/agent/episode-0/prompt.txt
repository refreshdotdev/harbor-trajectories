You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are helping a developer clean-up and reorganize a small project’s raw datasets. 
    The workspace already contains three raw data files (two CSVs and one messy text file) and a random notes file. 
    These need to be merged, cleaned, summarized, and archived. 

    Make sure every requested artefact is created exactly as specified, including directory names, file names,
    file contents and *precise* JSON and CSV formatting (the automated grader will compare them byte-for-byte).

    Initial state (already present when you start):
    • /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/alpha.csv
    • /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/beta.csv
    • /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/gamma.csv (contains semicolon delimiters, comments, and whitespace)
    • /home/user/dev_project/raw_data/notes.txt

    Your tasks are as follows:

    1. Create the directory /home/user/dev_project/report
       (create parents first if they do not exist).

    2. Produce /home/user/dev_project/report/combined.csv that meets *all* of the following requirements:
       • It must contain **one** header line, exactly: `id,name,score`
       • It must merge valid data from `alpha.csv`, `beta.csv`, and `gamma.csv`.
       • Data cleaning rules:
         - Ignore any lines starting with `#`.
         - Normalize all delimiters to commas.
         - Trim any leading/trailing whitespace from names and scores.
       • **Sorting**: The final rows must be sorted by `id` in ascending numerical order.
       • Lines must be separated by a single Unix newline (`\n`).
       • There must be *no* blank line at the end of the file.

       Expected final byte-for-byte contents of combined.csv:
       ```
       id,name,score
       1,Alice,88
       2,Bob,92
       3,Charlie,67
       4,Denise,75
       5,Evan,83
       6,Faith,91
       7,George,80
       8,Hannah,90
       ```

    3. Create /home/user/dev_project/report/summary.json which must be a
       single-line, minified JSON document (no extra whitespace except the one
       blank space after each colon). The required contents are:

       {"total_rows":8,"average_score":83.25,"max_score":92,"min_score":67,"top_performer":{"id":2,"name":"Bob","score":92},"data_sha256":"<SHA256_HASH>"}

       Notes:
       • `data_sha256` must be the lowercase SHA256 hex digest of the final `combined.csv` file content.
       • `average_score` must be rounded to exactly two decimal places.
       • The object members must appear in the exact order shown above.
       • summary.json must end with a Unix newline character.

    4. Archive the source files:
       • Move `alpha.csv`, `beta.csv`, and `gamma.csv` into `/home/user/dev_project/archive/raw_data/`.
       • Move `notes.txt` into `/home/user/dev_project/archive/skipped/`.
       • Ensure the original `raw_data` directory is empty.

    5. Generate a plain-text processing log at
       /home/user/dev_project/report/process.log. The file must contain
       exactly three lines (each terminated with `\n`):

       2023-01-01 10:00:00 Combined 3 data files. Final size: <BYTES> bytes
       2023-01-01 10:00:01 Generated summary.json with checksum
       2023-01-01 10:00:02 Archived source files

       Replace `<BYTES>` with the actual byte count of your generated `combined.csv`.
       Do **not** append any additional output or blank lines.

    Verification hints:
    • The grader will check that combined.csv, summary.json and process.log
      exist at the exact paths and match the contents shown above *byte for byte*.
    • Ensure your SHA256 calculation is performed on the final file content (with no trailing newline).

    You do not have root privileges; stay within /home/user.
    Show any intermediate console output you find helpful.
