We have a nightly cron job that dumps raw billing data into `/home/user/incoming`. Your task is to write a robust Bash script (`solve.sh`) that processes these files according to the strict protocols of our mainframe upstream systems.\n\n## Environment & Configuration\n\nThe system configuration is located at `/etc/legacy_etl/settings.conf`. You must read this file to determine the `REGION_CODE` and the `RETENTION_POLICY` (though retention is currently handled by another process, the region code is critical for naming). Note that this file follows a standard `KEY=VALUE` format, but may contain comments starting with `#`. \n\n## Processing Logic\n\n### 1. Input Validation\nThe directory `/home/user/incoming` contains several CSV files. However, due to a known bug in the FTP transfer tool, some files arrive with a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM). \n\n**CRITICAL:** The upstream mainframe crashes if it encounters a BOM. You must inspect the beginning of every CSV file. \n- If a file starts with the UTF-8 BOM bytes (`0xEF`, `0xBB`, `0xBF`), it is considered **corrupt**. Move it immediately to `/home/user/etl/quarantine` without processing it further.\n- Only \"clean\" CSV files (standard ASCII/UTF-8 without BOM) should be processed.\n\n### 2. Archival (Format Conversion)\nWe need to archive the valid data, but the archival system strictly requires **Tab-Separated Values (TSV)**, not CSV. \n\nCreate a gzip-compressed tarball in `/home/user/etl/archive`. \n- The tarball name must follow this exact pattern: `data_<REGION_CODE>_<YYYYMMDD>_<TOTAL_RECORDS>.tar.gz`.\n  - `<YYYYMMDD>` is the current date (server time).\n  - `<TOTAL_RECORDS>` is the sum of all **data rows** (excluding headers) across all valid processed files.\n- Inside the tarball, the files must be converted to TSV format and have the `.tsv` extension. For example, `orders.csv` becomes `orders.tsv` inside the archive.\n- The archive must contain *only* the converted TSV files, with no directory structure (bare filenames).\n\n### 3. Raw Backup\nMove the *original, unmodified* valid CSV files from `/home/user/incoming` to `/home/user/etl/raw_backup`. The quarantine files should already be in `/home/user/etl/quarantine`. After this step, `/home/user/incoming` must be empty.\n\n### 4. Staging & Transformation\nExtract the TSV files from your newly created archive into `/home/user/etl/staging`. \n- **Post-Extraction Requirement:** The `orders.tsv` file contains a `total_amount` column (3rd column). The Finance team requires this file to be sorted by that amount in **descending numeric order**. Overwrite `orders.tsv` in the staging directory with this sorted version.\n\n### 5. Manifest Generation\nCreate a manifest file at `/home/user/etl/logs/process_manifest.txt`. \n\n**Formatting Rules:**\n- The file **MUST** be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). This is non-negotiable.\n- The first line must be exactly: `Legacy ETL Manifest \u00a9 2023` (Note the copyright symbol).\n- Subsequent lines should list each valid processed file (using the original CSV filename) in alphabetical order:\n  `filename|original_md5_hash|data_row_count`\n\n(Note: The MD5 hash should be calculated from the original CSV file in the backup folder, not the TSV. The row count excludes the header.)\n\n## Summary of Artifacts\n\nUpon completion, the automated checker will verify:\n1. `quarantine` contains any BOM-tainted files.\n2. `raw_backup` contains the original valid CSVs.\n3. `archive` contains a tarball with the correct dynamic name and TSV contents.\n4. `staging` contains the TSVs, with `orders.tsv` sorted descending by amount.\n5. `logs/process_manifest.txt` exists, is ISO-8859-1 encoded, has the copyright header, and correct file metadata.\n\nGood luck. The mainframe is unforgiving.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@a0eea0e5-02a2-44b8-82aa-a589fdbe2c7a:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You must inspect the beginning of every CSV file. \n- If a file starts with the UTF-8 BOM bytes (`0xEF`, `0xBB`, `0xBF`), it is considered **corrupt**. Move it immediately to `/home/user/etl/quarantine` without processing it further.\n- Only \"clean\" CSV files (standard ASCII/UTF-8 without BOM) should be processed.\n\n### 2. Archival (Format Conversion)\nWe need to archive the valid data, but the archival system strictly requires **Tab-Separated Values (TSV)**, not CSV. \n\nCreate a gzip-compressed tarball in `/home/user/etl/archive`. \n- The tarball name must follow this exact pattern: `data_<REGION_CODE>_<YYYYMMDD>_<TOTAL_RECORDS>.tar.gz`.\n  - `<YYYYMMDD>` is the current date (server time).\n  - `<TOTAL_RECORDS>` is the sum of all **data rows** (excluding headers) across all valid processed files.\n- Inside the tarball, the files must be converted to TSV format and have the `.tsv` extension. For example, `orders.csv` becomes `orders.tsv` inside the archive.\n- The archive must contain *only* the converted TSV files, with no directory structure (bare filenames).\n\n### 3. Raw Backup\nMove the *original, unmodified* valid CSV files from `/home/user/incoming` to `/home/user/etl/raw_backup`. The quarantine files should already be in `/home/user/etl/quarantine`. After this step, `/home/user/incoming` must be empty.\n\n### 4. Staging & Transformation\nExtract the TSV files from your newly created archive into `/home/user/etl/staging`. \n- **Post-Extraction Requirement:** The `orders.tsv` file contains a `total_amount` column (3rd column). The Finance team requires this file to be sorted by that amount in **descending numeric order**. Overwrite `orders.tsv` in the staging directory with this sorted version.\n\n### 5. Manifest Generation\nCreate a manifest file at `/home/user/etl/logs/process_manifest.txt`. \n\n**Formatting Rules:**\n- The file **MUST** be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). This is non-negotiable.\n- The first line must be exactly: `Legacy ETL Manifest \u00a9 2023` (Note the copyright symbol).\n- Subsequent lines should list each valid processed file (using the original CSV filename) in alphabetical order:\n  `filename|original_md5_hash|data_row_count`\n\n(Note: The MD5 hash should be calculated from the original CSV file in the backup folder, not the TSV. The row count excludes the header.)\n\n## Summary of Artifacts\n\nUpon completion, the automated checker will verify:\n1. `quarantine` contains any BOM-tainted files.\n2. `raw_backup` contains the original valid CSVs.\n3. `archive` contains a tarball with the correct dynamic name and TSV contents.\n4. `staging` contains the TSVs, with `orders.tsv` sorted descending by amount.\n5. `logs/process_manifest.txt` exists, is ISO-8859-1 encoded, has the copyright header, and correct file metadata.\n\nGood luck. The mainframe is unforgiving.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@a0eea0e5-02a2-44b8-82aa-a589fdbe2c7a:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
