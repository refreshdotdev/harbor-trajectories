However, I see that the input files `access.log` and `error.log` are both empty (0 bytes), and `usage.csv` is very small (48 bytes). This suggests that the actual log data content is missing from the environment. The task cannot be completed without valid input data to process.",
  "plan": "Since the required input files don't contain the necessary data to process, I will check if there are any hidden files or if the files were perhaps created with the wrong permissions. If no data is found, I should report the issue about missing input data. However, I will first verify the current directory contents and file permissions.",
