The previous admin was terminated for incompetence, specifically for failing to handle character encodings and specific file formats required by the archaic upstream monitoring systems. You have been given a second chance to fix the daily reporting pipeline.\n\nInside your workspace `/home/user/server_logs/`, you will find the raw data:\n\n*   `access.log`: Apache traffic logs. Note that the logging daemon occasionally writes comment lines starting with `#` during restarts, which must be ignored.\n*   `error.log`: Application logs.\n*   `usage.csv`: Resource metrics provided by the Finance department (likely exported from Excel).\n\nYour task is to generate a set of summary artifacts in a new directory `/home/user/server_logs/summary/`. If the directory does not exist, create it.\n\n## The Artifacts\n\nUnlike modern systems, our upstream consumers are extremely picky about file formats, encodings, and line terminators. Read the following requirements carefully. Most failures occur because engineers ignore the \"legacy\" constraints buried in the documentation.\n\n### 1. The Access Summary\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/access_summary.txt`\n\nThis file is consumed by a Windows-based legacy billing system. It requires a list of **successful (HTTP 200)** requests per IP address. \n\n*   **Filtering**: Ignore any line where the status code is not 200. Ignore any line starting with `#`.\n*   **Sorting**: Sort primarily by hit count (descending). If counts are equal, sort by IP address (lexicographically ascending).\n*   **Format**: `<IP> <COUNT>`.\n*   **Critical Constraint**: Since the consumer is a Windows host, this file **must use CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings**. Standard Linux LF endings will cause the billing parser to hang.\n\n### 2. The Error Report\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/error_report.txt`\n\nThis report is displayed on a VT100 terminal dashboard in the server room. \n\n*   **Filtering**: Include only `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` messages.\n*   **Aggregation**: Count these events per calendar day.\n*   **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD [Day]: <Count>` (e.g., `2023-10-12 [Thu]: 7`).\n*   **Sorting**: Chronological ascending.\n*   **Critical Constraint**: The VT100 hardware does not support UTF-8. You **must encode this file as ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. If you save it as UTF-8, the multi-byte characters will garble the display.\n\n### 3. CPU Utilization CSV\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/avg_cpu_by_server.csv`\n\n*   **Data Source**: `usage.csv`. Be aware that because this file comes from Excel, it may contain a **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** at the very beginning. Your script must handle or strip this, otherwise the column headers will be corrupt.\n*   **Normalization**: Server names appear in mixed case (e.g., \"Srv1\", \"SRV1\"). Normalize all server names to **lowercase**.\n*   **Calculation**: Compute the mean CPU percentage per server.\n*   **Format**: A standard CSV file. However, the header row must be exactly: `SERVER,AVG_CPU` (uppercase headers). The values must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n*   **Sorting**: Descending by CPU value. If values match, alphabetical by server name.\n\n### 4. Stats JSON\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/stats.json`\n\nA machine-readable summary containing exactly two keys: `total_errors` (sum of all counts in the error report) and `total_success_requests` (sum of all counts in the access summary). \n\n*   **Format**: Minified JSON (single line, no spaces after colons or commas).\n\n### 5. Maintenance Audit Log\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/maintenance_audit.log`\n\nThis is a concatenated view of the text-based reports. Because the previous format was too hard to parse, the new requirement uses specific section headers. The file must look **exactly** like this:\n\n```text\n=== [ACCESS] ===\n<contents of access_summary.txt>\n\n=== [ERRORS] ===\n<contents of error_report.txt>\n\n=== [CPU] ===\n<contents of avg_cpu_by_server.csv (excluding header)>\n\n=== [STATS] ===\n<contents of stats.json>\n```\n\n*   **Spacing**: Ensure exactly one blank line between the end of a block and the next header. Ensure no trailing blank lines at the end of the file.\n*   **Encoding**: This file should be standard UTF-8/ASCII (Linux defaults).\n\n### 6. Integrity Manifest\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/manifest.txt`\n\nFinally, to ensure no bit-rot occurs during transfer, you must generate a checksum manifest. \n\n*   **Content**: MD5 hashes of the five files generated above (`access_summary.txt`, `error_report.txt`, `avg_cpu_by_server.csv`, `stats.json`, `maintenance_audit.log`).\n*   **Format**: The standard output of the `md5sum` tool is acceptable (hash, two spaces, filename). The filenames should be relative (e.g., `access_summary.txt`), not absolute.\n*   **Sorting**: Sort the lines by filename alphabetically.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n*   **Tools**: You must use `awk` (or `gawk`) and `sed` for the core logic. You may use `iconv`, `unix2dos` (or equivalent sed logic), and `md5sum`.\n*   **Privileges**: You are a standard user. Do not try to install packages.\n*   **Environment**: `LC_ALL` is set to `C`.\n*   **Input Files**: Do not modify the original files in `/home/user/server_logs/`.\n\nGood luck. The last admin failed because they ignored the BOM in the CSV and sent LF line endings to Windows.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@56fee7c0-6817-457d-a718-9c330e539360:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

CPU Utilization CSV\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/avg_cpu_by_server.csv`\n\n*   **Data Source**: `usage.csv`. Be aware that because this file comes from Excel, it may contain a **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** at the very beginning. Your script must handle or strip this, otherwise the column headers will be corrupt.\n*   **Normalization**: Server names appear in mixed case (e.g., \"Srv1\", \"SRV1\"). Normalize all server names to **lowercase**.\n*   **Calculation**: Compute the mean CPU percentage per server.\n*   **Format**: A standard CSV file. However, the header row must be exactly: `SERVER,AVG_CPU` (uppercase headers). The values must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n*   **Sorting**: Descending by CPU value. If values match, alphabetical by server name.\n\n### 4. Stats JSON\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/stats.json`\n\nA machine-readable summary containing exactly two keys: `total_errors` (sum of all counts in the error report) and `total_success_requests` (sum of all counts in the access summary). \n\n*   **Format**: Minified JSON (single line, no spaces after colons or commas).\n\n### 5. Maintenance Audit Log\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/maintenance_audit.log`\n\nThis is a concatenated view of the text-based reports. Because the previous format was too hard to parse, the new requirement uses specific section headers. The file must look **exactly** like this:\n\n```text\n=== [ACCESS] ===\n<contents of access_summary.txt>\n\n=== [ERRORS] ===\n<contents of error_report.txt>\n\n=== [CPU] ===\n<contents of avg_cpu_by_server.csv (excluding header)>\n\n=== [STATS] ===\n<contents of stats.json>\n```\n\n*   **Spacing**: Ensure exactly one blank line between the end of a block and the next header. Ensure no trailing blank lines at the end of the file.\n*   **Encoding**: This file should be standard UTF-8/ASCII (Linux defaults).\n\n### 6. Integrity Manifest\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/manifest.txt`\n\nFinally, to ensure no bit-rot occurs during transfer, you must generate a checksum manifest. \n\n*   **Content**: MD5 hashes of the five files generated above (`access_summary.txt`, `error_report.txt`, `avg_cpu_by_server.csv`, `stats.json`, `maintenance_audit.log`).\n*   **Format**: The standard output of the `md5sum` tool is acceptable (hash, two spaces, filename). The filenames should be relative (e.g., `access_summary.txt`), not absolute.\n*   **Sorting**: Sort the lines by filename alphabetically.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n*   **Tools**: You must use `awk` (or `gawk`) and `sed` for the core logic. You may use `iconv`, `unix2dos` (or equivalent sed logic), and `md5sum`.\n*   **Privileges**: You are a standard user.

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration.

The previous admin was terminated for incompetence, specifically for failing to handle character encodings and specific file formats required by the archaic upstream monitoring systems. You have been given a second chance to fix the daily reporting pipeline.\n\nInside your workspace `/home/user/server_logs/`, you will find the raw data:\n\n*   `access.log`: Apache traffic logs. Note that the logging daemon occasionally writes comment lines starting with `#` during restarts, which must be ignored.\n*   `error.log`: Application logs.\n*   `usage.csv`: Resource metrics provided by the Finance department (likely exported from Excel).\n\nYour task is to generate a set of summary artifacts in a new directory `/home/user/server_logs/summary/`. If the directory does not exist, create it.\n\n## The Artifacts\n\nUnlike modern systems, our upstream consumers are extremely picky about file formats, encodings, and line terminators. Read the following requirements carefully. Most failures occur because engineers ignore the \"legacy\" constraints buried in the documentation.\n\n### 1. The Access Summary\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/access_summary.txt`\n\nThis file is consumed by a Windows-based legacy billing system. It requires a list of **successful (HTTP 200)** requests per IP address. \n\n*   **Filtering**: Ignore any line where the status code is not 200. Ignore any line starting with `#`.\n*   **Sorting**: Sort primarily by hit count (descending). If counts are equal, sort by IP address (lexicographically ascending).\n*   **Format**: `<IP> <COUNT>`.\n*   **Critical Constraint**: Since the consumer is a Windows host, this file **must use CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings**. Standard Linux LF endings will cause the billing parser to hang.\n\n### 2. The Error Report\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/error_report.txt`\n\nThis report is displayed on a VT100 terminal dashboard in the server room. \n\n*   **Filtering**: Include only `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` messages.\n*   **Aggregation**: Count these events per calendar day.\n*   **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD [Day]: <Count>` (e.g., `2023-10-12 [Thu]: 7`).\n*   **Sorting**: Chronological ascending.\n*   **Critical Constraint**: The VT100 hardware does not support UTF-8. You **must encode this file as ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**. If you save it as UTF-8, the multi-byte characters will garble the display.\n\n### 3. CPU Utilization CSV\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/avg_cpu_by_server.csv`\n\n*   **Data Source**: `usage.csv`. Be aware that because this file comes from Excel, it may contain a **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** at the very beginning. Your script must handle or strip this, otherwise the column headers will be corrupt.\n*   **Normalization**: Server names appear in mixed case (e.g., \"Srv1\", \"SRV1\"). Normalize all server names to **lowercase**.\n*   **Calculation**: Compute the mean CPU percentage per server.\n*   **Format**: A standard CSV file. However, the header row must be exactly: `SERVER,AVG_CPU` (uppercase headers). The values must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n*   **Sorting**: Descending by CPU value. If values match, alphabetical by server name.\n\n### 4. Stats JSON\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/stats.json`\n\nA machine-readable summary containing exactly two keys: `total_errors` (sum of all counts in the error report) and `total_success_requests` (sum of all counts in the access summary). \n\n*   **Format**: Minified JSON (single line, no spaces after colons or commas).\n\n### 5. Maintenance Audit Log\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/maintenance_audit.log`\n\nThis is a concatenated view of the text-based reports. Because the previous format was too hard to parse, the new requirement uses specific section headers. The file must look **exactly** like this:\n\n```text\n=== [ACCESS] ===\n<contents of access_summary.txt>\n\n=== [ERRORS] ===\n<contents of error_report.txt>\n\n=== [CPU] ===\n<contents of avg_cpu_by_server.csv (excluding header)>\n\n=== [STATS] ===\n<contents of stats.json>\n```\n\n*   **Spacing**: Ensure exactly one blank line between the end of a block and the next header. Ensure no trailing blank lines at the end of the file.\n*   **Encoding**: This file should be standard UTF-8/ASCII (Linux defaults).\n\n### 6. Integrity Manifest\n**Path**: `/home/user/server_logs/summary/manifest.txt`\n\nFinally, to ensure no bit-rot occurs during transfer, you must generate a checksum manifest. \n\n*   **Content**: MD5 hashes of the five files generated above (`access_summary.txt`, `error_report.txt`, `avg_cpu_by_server.csv`, `stats.json`, `maintenance_audit.log`).\n*   **Format**: The standard output of the `md5sum` tool is acceptable (hash, two spaces, filename). The filenames should be relative (e.g., `access_summary.txt`), not absolute.\n*   **Sorting**: Sort the lines by filename alphabetically.\n\n## Summary of Constraints\n*   **Tools**: You must use `awk` (or `gawk`) and `sed` for the core logic.
