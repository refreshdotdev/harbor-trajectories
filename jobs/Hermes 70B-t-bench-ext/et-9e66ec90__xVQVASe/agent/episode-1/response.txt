  "analysis": "I have successfully navigated to the project directory and verified its structure. The necessary subdirectories (`audit`, `rendered`, `logs`) already exist. The `config` directory contains three files: `base.env`, `overlay.env`, and `defaults.env`. I can see that `base.env` and `defaults.env` are empty, while `overlay.env` has content. My next step is to examine the contents of `overlay.env` to understand its structure and handle any potential Windows-specific artifacts like Byte Order Marks.",
  "plan": "I will first inspect the contents of `overlay.env`. Since this file might contain Windows-specific artifacts, I'll use a command that can detect potential issues. After examining the file, I'll begin the configuration loading process by parsing `base.env` and then `overlay.env`, carefully merging them while handling any Windows-specific characters. The `defaults.env` file will be ignored as per security requirements.",
