  "analysis": "The pre-flight JSON file has been created at `/home/user/k8s/audit/preflight.json`. However, the JSON contains HTML-encoded quotes (`&quot;`) instead of regular double quotes, and the special character '§' is present as a UTF-8 character. The file also contains spaces around the commas and some line wrapping, making it not fully compact. The file size is 207 bytes. I need to recreate this file with proper JSON formatting and ensure it's compact as required.",
  "plan": "I will use a different approach to create the JSON file, this time using `printf` with literal quotes and ensuring no extra spaces are added. I'll also verify the exact byte count of the resulting file. After creating the corrected JSON, I'll proceed to the manifest rendering step, which involves processing the template file with the configured variables.",
