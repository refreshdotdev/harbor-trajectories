The file contains 478 bytes and has the correct CRLF line endings (as shown by the `\r\n` sequences when using `cat -v`). All placeholders have been substituted with their correct values: APP_NAME='titan_omega', ENVIRONMENT='prod_§1', API_KEY_SPECIAL='OTlfdG5lZ2FfdGVyY2VzCg==', and TEMPLATE_HASH='e3b0c442'. The file is UTF-8 encoded as required.",
  "plan": "With the manifest rendering complete and verified, the next step is to generate the deployment log at `/home/user/k8s/logs/render.log`. This log must contain specific lines with variable values and checksums, and it must be encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) to be compatible with the legacy mainframe system. I'll need to calculate the MD5 hash of the pre-flight JSON file and the SHA256 hash of the rendered manifest file for inclusion in the log.",
