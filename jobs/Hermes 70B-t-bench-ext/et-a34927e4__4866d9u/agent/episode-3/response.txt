The report will indicate that no winner was found due to the absence of valid data.",
  "plan": "1. Calculate the SHA256 hash of the empty `manifest.csv` file. 2. Get the current UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format for the `AUDIT_DATE` field. 3. Since there is no winning run, set `WINNER_ID` to 'none'. 4. The `MANIFEST_LINE` should be set to 0 because there are no lines in the manifest. 5. The `VARIABLES` field should be empty since there is no winning run. 6. Format the final report content accordingly.",
