      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Optimization Audit & Consolidation Task\n\nYou are a backend integration engineer working on a legacy audit pipeline. Your system receives optimization results from multiple generations of solver engines, consolidates the data for a Windows-based auditing tool, and generates a final signed report.\n\n## Environment & Configuration\n\nThe working environment contains several configuration sources and data directories. It is critical that you use the **system-wide** configuration deployed by the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, located at `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`, rather than any local developer overrides you might find in the user home directory.\n\n### Input Data\n\nThe solver outputs are located in `/home/user/api_test/responses`. This directory contains a mix of files:\n\n1.  **Modern Solver Outputs (`.json`)**: Standard RFC-compliant JSON files encoded in UTF-8.\n2.  **Legacy Solver Outputs (`.log`)**: These are \"JSON-like\" files generated by an old C++ subsystem.\n    *   **Encoding**: These files are strictly encoded in **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**.\n    *   **Comments**: They may contain C-style single-line comments (`// ...`) which are not valid JSON. You must strip these comments before parsing.\n    *   **Note**: Attempting to read these as UTF-8 will cause errors due to special characters used in the comments.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\nYou must write a solution that processes these files in a specific multi-stage pipeline.\n\n### Stage 1: Ingestion & Normalization\n\nScan the responses directory. Ignore any files that do not end in `.json` or `.log`. For every file, parse the content (handling the encoding and comment stripping for legacy files described above). Discard any run where the `status` field is not \"optimal\" (case-insensitive).\n\n### Stage 2: The Audit Manifest\n\nBefore determining the \"winner\", you must generate an intermediate audit manifest.\n\n*   **File Path**: `/home/user/api_test/processed/manifest.csv`\n*   **Content**: A CSV file listing the `id`, `objective_value`, and `timestamp` of **every** valid optimal run found in Stage 1.\n*   **Ordering**: The rows must be sorted by `timestamp` in **descending** order (newest first).\n*   **Format Constraints**: \n    *   Columns: `id,objective,timestamp`\n    *   Since this file is consumed by a legacy Windows tool, it **must** use CRLF (`\\r\\n`) line endings. This is a strict requirement.\n    *   No header row.\n\n### Stage 3: Winner Selection\n\nSelect the single \"best\" run from the valid optimal runs identified in Stage 1.\n\n1.  **Primary Criteria**: Lowest `objective_value`.\n2.  **Tie-Breaker**: If objective values are equal, consult the `tie_breaker` key in the system configuration file (`/opt/solver/settings.yaml`).\n    *   If set to `latest`, pick the run with the highest timestamp.\n    *   If set to `earliest`, pick the run with the lowest timestamp.\n\n### Stage 4: Final Report\n\nGenerate the final log file at `/home/user/api_test/optimization_report.log`. The format is specific and must be exact.\n\n**Required Content & Format:**\n\n```text\nAUDIT_DATE: <current_utc_date_iso8601>\nWINNER_ID: <id_of_winning_run>\nMANIFEST_SHA256: <sha256_checksum_of_manifest.csv>\nMANIFEST_LINE: <line_number_of_winner_in_manifest.csv>\nVARIABLES: <formatted_variable_list>\n```\n\n**Field Details:**\n*   `AUDIT_DATE`: The current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (UTC).\n*   `MANIFEST_SHA256`: The hexadecimal SHA256 hash of the *exact* binary content of the `manifest.csv` file created in Stage 2. This ensures the audit trail is tamper-proof.\n*   `MANIFEST_LINE`: The 1-based line number where the winning run appears in the sorted `manifest.csv`.\n*   `VARIABLES`: A comma-separated list of the `x` array from the winning run, filtered and formatted as follows:\n    *   **Threshold**: Only include variables where `abs(x)` is strictly greater than the `variable_threshold` defined in `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`.\n    *   **Formatting**: \n        *   If `abs(x) < 0.01`, format in scientific notation with 2 decimal places (e.g., `5.00e-04`).\n        *   Otherwise, format as a fixed-point number with 2 decimal places (e.g., `1.23`).\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\n\nBy the end of execution, the following must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/api_test/processed/manifest.csv` (CRLF line endings, sorted by time desc).\n2.  `/home/user/api_test/optimization_report.log` (Containing the hash of the manifest).\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@7e3f7825-c990-46bc-a417-6534e990d184:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
