  "analysis": "The task requires a multi-stage pipeline to process solver outputs, generate an audit manifest, select a winner, and produce a final report. The system-wide configuration is at `/opt/solver/settings.yaml`, and input data is in `/home/user/api_test/responses`. Key requirements include handling legacy `.log` files (ISO-8859-1 encoding, C-style comments to be stripped), generating a CSV manifest with CRLF line endings, and performing specific winner selection logic based on configuration. The current terminal is at the root user's home directory.",
  "plan": "I will start by navigating to the `/home/user/api_test` directory to work in the context of the task. Then, I'll examine the system-wide configuration file at `/opt/solver/settings.yaml` to understand tie-breaking rules and variable thresholds. Subsequently, I'll check the input data directory `/home/user/api_test/responses` to see what files need processing. This initial exploration will set the stage for developing the full pipeline script.",
