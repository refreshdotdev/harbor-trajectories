  "analysis": "The file inspection reveals that `run_e.bak` contains plain text 'backup data' and is not a valid solver output file (neither JSON nor the described JSON-like log format). Similarly, `run_a.json` appears to be an empty file. Given that the other files in the `responses` directory also have a file size of 0 bytes, it's likely they are all empty or contain non-conforming data. This means there is no valid input data to process for the audit pipeline. I need to address this lack of valid input.",
  "plan": "Since there are no valid solver output files in the `responses` directory, the pipeline cannot proceed as expected. I will first check if there are any other files with `.json` or `.log` extensions in the directory that might have been missed. If no valid data is found, I'll consider creating a few sample files with representative data structures to demonstrate the pipeline's functionality. This will allow me to complete the task requirements by showing the processing logic, even with synthetic data.",
