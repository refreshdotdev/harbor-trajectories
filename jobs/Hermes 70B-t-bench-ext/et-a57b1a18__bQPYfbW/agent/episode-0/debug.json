He was working on a Python-based regression test harness for our partner's REST API. The infrastructure is a mix of legacy Linux servers and new Windows CI agents, which has led to some specific, non-negotiable requirements regarding file formats and encodings.\n\nDave left a folder at `/home/user/projects/api-test` containing an `input` directory with some JSON samples. You need to complete the harness by writing a solution that generates the required Schema, validates the inputs, and produces specific output artifacts.\n\n**Dave's Handover Notes (READ CAREFULLY)**\n\n> \"Hey, sorry to leave this half-finished. Here is what needs to be done:\n> \n> 1. **The Schema**: You need to generate `/home/user/projects/api-test/schema/user.schema.json`. \n>    The user object is tricky. We have three roles now: 'admin', 'user', and 'manager'.\n>    - Everyone has `id` (int), `name` (str), `email` (email fmt), `isActive` (bool), and `role` (enum).\n>    - **Admins** always need a `department` (string).\n>    - **Users** must NEVER have a `department` field.\n>    - **Managers** are the worst: they need a `department` ONLY if they are `isActive=true`. If a manager is inactive, they lose their department (field must be absent).\n>    - No other extra properties allowed.\n>\n> 2. **Input Processing**: \n>    Process every `.json` file in the `input` folder. \n>    Watch out for symlinks\u2014I think someone symlinked a file to itself to test infinite loops; just ignore any symlinks completely. \n>    Also, the Windows team keeps committing files with Byte Order Marks (BOM). The parser needs to handle those gracefully. If you strip a BOM, mark it in the log.\n>\n> 3. **The Log File (`output/validation.log`)**:\n>    This is critical. The Ops team uses an ancient viewer that crashes on UTF-8. You MUST write this file using **ISO-8859-1** encoding. \n>    Also, there's a config file somewhere\u2014check the environment variable `TEST_CONF` for the path.

It must end exactly on the closing bracket `]`.\n>\n> 5. **The Summary (`output/summary.txt`)**:\n>    The CI server runs on Windows. It expects **CRLF** (`\\r\\n`) line endings.
