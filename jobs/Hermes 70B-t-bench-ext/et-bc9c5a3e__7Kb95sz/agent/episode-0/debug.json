(If a `.old` file also exists, overwrite it).\n\n### Measurements\n\nGenerate **five** measurements using built-in, non-interactive commands:\n1.  **CPU core count**\n2.  **Total installed memory** (in MiB)\n3.  **Sequential disk write speed** in MiB/s (measured with a temporary file that is later removed)\n4.  **Median network round-trip latency** to 8.8.8.8 in ms, calculated from **exactly five** ICMP echo requests.\n5.  **Network Jitter** in ms, calculated as the difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** round-trip times of the **same five** ICMP echo requests used for the latency measurement.\n\n### Audit Log\n\nImmediately after every measurement, append a single-line record to the log file `benchmark_audit.log` in the target directory.\n\nEach record **must** follow this pipe-delimited format (one physical line, no wrapping):\n`TIMESTAMP|MEASUREMENT_NAME|RAW_VALUE|UNIT|COMMAND`\n\n*   **TIMESTAMP**: ISO-8601 combined date and time in UTC, precise to whole seconds, e.g. `2024-05-14T18:03:21Z`\n*   **MEASUREMENT_NAME**: one of `CPU_CORES`, `MEM_TOTAL_MIB`, `DISK_WRITE_MIBPS`, `NET_LATENCY_MS`, `NET_JITTER_MS`\n*   **RAW_VALUE**: a positive decimal number (integer or float) extracted from the command output\n*   **UNIT**: \u201ccount\u201d, \u201cMiB\u201d, \u201cMiB/s\u201d, or \u201cms\u201d respectively\n*   **COMMAND**: exactly the full command line you executed to obtain the value\n\nExample (do **not** copy literally):\n`2024-05-14T18:03:21Z|CPU_CORES|4|count|nproc`\n\n### Summary Report\n\nAfter all five measurements have been logged, create a machine-readable summary file at `benchmark_summary.json` in the target directory with the following **exact key set and ordering**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cpu_core_count\": <number>,\n  \"total_memory_bytes\": <number>,\n  \"disk_write_mib_per_sec\": <number>,\n  \"network_latency_ms\": <number>,\n  \"network_jitter_ms\": <number>,\n  \"benchmark_duration_seconds\": <number>,\n  \"timestamp\": \"ISO-8601 UTC string\"\n}\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   **total_memory_bytes**: Must be the memory value converted to **Bytes** (integer).\n*   **benchmark_duration_seconds**: The elapsed time in seconds between the timestamp of the **first** log entry and the **last** log entry.
