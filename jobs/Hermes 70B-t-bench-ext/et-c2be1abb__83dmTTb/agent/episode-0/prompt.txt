You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a forensic data analyst working on a post-incident review. A legacy Windows server was compromised, and the incident response team has dumped a raw archive of the relevant logs and configuration snippets.

Your task is to process this archive, extract specific log entries, merge them, and generate a sanitized report for the legal department. The legal department uses an ancient document viewer, so strict adherence to encoding and formatting constraints is critical.

### Current Situation

*   **Directory**: `/home/user/incident_response`
*   **Input File**: `/home/user/incident_response/evidence.zip`
    *   This archive contains multiple files in a directory structure.
    *   You must extract it to process the contents.

### Processing Requirements

1.  **Configuration Discovery**:
    *   Inside the archive, locate a configuration file named `redaction.conf`.
    *   This file contains a single line of text (e.g., `REDACTED_BY_SEC_TEAM`). You must use this *exact* string for all redactions.

2.  **Log Merging and Filtering**:
    *   The archive contains two log files: `server_app.log` and `server_sys.log`.
    *   **Encoding Trap**: `server_app.log` is UTF-16LE (with BOM). `server_sys.log` is Windows-1252 (CP1252).
    *   **Content**: Both files contain lines starting with a timestamp in the format `[DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS]`, followed by a severity level and a message.
    *   **Filtering**: You must exclude any log lines where the severity level is `DEBUG` or `TRACE`. Keep `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.
    *   **Redaction**: Replace any IPv4 address (pattern `X.X.X.X`) found in the messages with the string found in `redaction.conf`.

3.  **Sorting (The "Chronological" Requirement)**:
    *   Merge the valid lines from both files into a single list.
    *   Sort the merged list by **Timestamp Descending** (Newest first).
    *   *Note*: A simple lexicographical sort will fail because the date format is Day-First (`DD/MM/YYYY`). You must parse the dates to sort correctly.

4.  **Header Generation**:
    *   The archive contains a binary file `signature.bin`.
    *   The first line of your output report must be the **MD5 hash** of this binary file.

5.  **Report Formatting (Strict)**:
    *   **Output Path**: `/home/user/incident_response/final_report.txt`
    *   **Encoding**: The output file must be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). Ensure all characters in the logs are compatible or replaced with `?`.
    *   **Line Endings**: The file must use Windows-style CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings for *every* line, including the header.
    *   **Structure**:
        Line 1: `<MD5_HASH_OF_SIGNATURE_BIN>`
        Line 2+: `<Timestamp> <Severity> <Redacted_Message>`

6.  **Manifest Generation**:
    *   Create a JSON manifest at `/home/user/incident_response/manifest.json`.
    *   It must contain exactly these keys:
        *   `processed_date`: The current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
        *   `total_lines_reported`: Integer count of log lines in the final report (excluding the header).
        *   `redaction_string`: The string used for redaction.
        *   `report_sha256`: The SHA256 hash of the generated `final_report.txt`.
    *   The JSON must be formatted with an indentation of 2 spaces.

### Verification

The grading script checks specific byte sequences. If your line endings are LF instead of CRLF, or if the sort order is wrong (e.g., `01/02/2023` appearing before `02/01/2023` in a descending sort), or if the encoding is UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, the task will fail.
