  "analysis": "The current directory is `/home/user/incident_response`, and there's an `evidence.zip` file present. No prior work has been done according to the terminal output. The task requires extracting this archive and performing several processing steps including configuration discovery, log merging/filtering with specific encoding conversions, timestamp sorting, header generation, strict report formatting, and manifest creation.",
  "plan": "First, I will extract the evidence.zip archive to access its contents. Then, I'll locate and read the redaction string from redaction.conf. After that, I will process each log file: convert server_app.log from UTF-16LE to UTF-8, convert server_sys.log from Windows-1252 to UTF-8, filter out DEBUG/TRACE lines, and redact IPv4 addresses using the string from redaction.conf. Both processed log sets will be merged, sorted chronologically (newest first) by parsing the DD/MM/YYYY timestamps, and converted to ISO-8859-1 encoding. The MD5 hash of signature.bin will be computed for the report header. Finally, I'll generate the final_report.txt with CRLF line endings and create a JSON manifest with the required metadata.",
