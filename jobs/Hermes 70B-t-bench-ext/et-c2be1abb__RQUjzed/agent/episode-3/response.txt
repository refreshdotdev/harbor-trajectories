  "plan": "1. Use `file` command to verify the encoding of `server_app.log` and `server_sys.log`. 2. If encodings are different from expected, convert them to a common format (UTF-8) for processing. 3. Filter log lines to exclude `DEBUG` and `TRACE` severities. 4. Redact IPv4 addresses using the `REDACTION_STRING`. 5. Merge and sort the logs chronologically. 6. Generate the report header from `signature.bin` and the final report in ISO-8859-1 encoding with CRLF line endings. 7. Create the JSON manifest.",
