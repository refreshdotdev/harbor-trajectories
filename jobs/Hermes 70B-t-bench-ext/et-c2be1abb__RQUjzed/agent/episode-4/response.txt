I will proceed with the assumption that `server_app.log` is UTF-16LE with BOM and `server_sys.log` is Windows-1252 as specified in the task description. If these assumptions are incorrect, the log processing may fail or produce unexpected results.",

Redact IPv4 addresses using the `REDACTION_STRING`. 5. Merge and sort the logs chronologically. 6. Generate the report header from `signature.bin` and the final report in ISO-8859-1 encoding with CRLF line endings. 7. Create the JSON manifest.",
