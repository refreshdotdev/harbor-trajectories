  "analysis": "The Part A commands (world-writable files scan) were concatenated due to missing newlines. I need to execute them one by one. The `find` command for Part A needs to be robust: exclude symbolic links with `! -type l`, exclude files in hidden directories (which `! -name '.*'` on files doesn't fully cover, so `-not -path '*/.*'` is for directories), and use `-perm -o=w` for world-writable. The `stat` format should be `%s  %n` (two spaces). Then, sort by size descending, then path ascending. The section headers and blank lines must be added carefully.",
  "plan": "1. Execute the world-writable file scan command. 2. Add the `-----BEGIN WORLD_WRITABLE-----` section header to the report. 3. Add the sorted list of world-writable files to the report. 4. Add a blank line after the world-writable section. 5. Proceed to Part B (TODO comments).",
