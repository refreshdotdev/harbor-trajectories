Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Security Scan for Legacy Mainframe Integration\n\nYou are a deployment engineer tasked with integrating a modern release process with \"OldGuard\", a legacy mainframe auditing system. You have just deployed an update to `/home/user/release` (or wherever the configuration specifies). You must generate a compliance report that meets the strict, archaic format requirements of the OldGuard system.\n\n## 1. Configuration\nUnlike modern tools, the scanner does not take command-line arguments. You must read the configuration from `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`. This file contains key-value pairs (e.g., `KEY = VALUE`).\n\n*   **ROOT_DIR**: The directory tree to scan.\n*   **REPORT_PATH**: The absolute path where the report must be saved.\n\n*Note: The configuration parser on the mainframe is robust against surrounding whitespace, so you should be too.*\n\n## 2. Scan Requirements\n\n### Part A: World-Writable Files\nIdentify all files in the `ROOT_DIR` tree that are **world-writable** (others have write permission). \n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   The mainframe sorts these entries by **File Size (Descending)**. If two files have the same size, sort them alphabetically by their absolute path.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH` (Note: Two spaces between size and path).\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Symbolic links.\n*   Files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n\n### Part B: TODO Comments\nSearch for the literal string \"TODO\" in source files.\n\n**Scope & Constraints:**\n*   Scan only files with extensions `.py` and `.log`.\n*   **Critical Constraint:** The mainframe has limited buffer memory. **Exclude any file larger than 10,240 bytes (10KB)** from this search entirely.\n*   Exclude symbolic links.\n*   Exclude files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n*   Exclude any line containing the safety suppression token \"NO_FIX\" (case-sensitive).\n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   Sort hits alphabetically by the file's **relative path** from `ROOT_DIR`, then by line number ascending.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `RELATIVE_PATH [LINE_NUMBER] CONTENT`\n*   Preserve the content spacing exactly as found in the file, but strip the trailing newline.\n\n## 3. Report Format & Encoding (CRITICAL)\n\nThe OldGuard system predates UTF-8. The report file **MUST** be written using **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding.\n\n*   If a source file contains characters that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 (e.g., emojis, complex unicode), you **must** replace them with a literal question mark (`?`). Faiure to sanitise these characters will cause the mainframe ingest to crash.\n*   The file must start with the header: `SCAN_ID: <value of $BUILD_ID environment variable>`\n*   Use the exact section separators shown below.\n\n**Integrity Checksum:**\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, the **very last line** of the report must be:\n`MD5: <checksum>`\n\nWhere `<checksum>` is the MD5 hex digest of the **entire file content preceding this line** (including the newline character of the last data line).\n\n### Exact Output Template:\n```text\nSCAN_ID: <$BUILD_ID>\n-----BEGIN WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n<size>  <path>\n...\n-----END WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n\n-----BEGIN TODO_LINES-----\n<rel_path> [<line>] <content>\n...\n-----END TODO_LINES-----\nMD5: <32_char_hex_hash>\n```\n*(Note: There is exactly one blank line between the end of one section and the start of the next)*\n\n## 4. Console Output\nAfter writing the report, print a single line of valid JSON to stdout:\n`{\"status\": \"complete\", \"report_file\": \"<actual_path_written>\"}`\n\n## Summary of Traps & Constraints\n*   Do not hardcode paths; read the INI file.\n*   Respect the 10KB size limit for TODO scanning.\n*   Ensure correct sorting (Size DESC for files, Path ASC for TODOs).\n*   **Strictly enforce ISO-8859-1 encoding** with `?` replacement.\n*   Calculate the MD5 checksum over the generated content and append it.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@f20579cc-b850-49ba-a4ff-8d22f3d01ed2:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Security Scan for Legacy Mainframe Integration\n\nYou are a deployment engineer tasked with integrating a modern release process with \"OldGuard\", a legacy mainframe auditing system. You have just deployed an update to `/home/user/release` (or wherever the configuration specifies). You must generate a compliance report that meets the strict, archaic format requirements of the OldGuard system.\n\n## 1. Configuration\nUnlike modern tools, the scanner does not take command-line arguments. You must read the configuration from `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`. This file contains key-value pairs (e.g., `KEY = VALUE`).\n\n*   **ROOT_DIR**: The directory tree to scan.\n*   **REPORT_PATH**: The absolute path where the report must be saved.\n\n*Note: The configuration parser on the mainframe is robust against surrounding whitespace, so you should be too.*\n\n## 2. Scan Requirements\n\n### Part A: World-Writable Files\nIdentify all files in the `ROOT_DIR` tree that are **world-writable** (others have write permission). \n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   The mainframe sorts these entries by **File Size (Descending)**. If two files have the same size, sort them alphabetically by their absolute path.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH` (Note: Two spaces between size and path).\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Symbolic links.\n*   Files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n\n### Part B: TODO Comments\nSearch for the literal string \"TODO\" in source files.\n\n**Scope & Constraints:**\n*   Scan only files with extensions `.py` and `.log`.\n*   **Critical Constraint:** The mainframe has limited buffer memory. **Exclude any file larger than 10,240 bytes (10KB)** from this search entirely.\n*   Exclude symbolic links.\n*   Exclude files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n*   Exclude any line containing the safety suppression token \"NO_FIX\" (case-sensitive).\n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   Sort hits alphabetically by the file's **relative path** from `ROOT_DIR`, then by line number ascending.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `RELATIVE_PATH [LINE_NUMBER] CONTENT`\n*   Preserve the content spacing exactly as found in the file, but strip the trailing newline.\n\n## 3. Report Format & Encoding (CRITICAL)\n\nThe OldGuard system predates UTF-8. The report file **MUST** be written using **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding.\n\n*   If a source file contains characters that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 (e.g., emojis, complex unicode), you **must** replace them with a literal question mark (`?`). Faiure to sanitise these characters will cause the mainframe ingest to crash.\n*   The file must start with the header: `SCAN_ID: <value of $BUILD_ID environment variable>`\n*   Use the exact section separators shown below.\n\n**Integrity Checksum:**\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, the **very last line** of the report must be:\n`MD5: <checksum>`\n\nWhere `<checksum>` is the MD5 hex digest of the **entire file content preceding this line** (including the newline character of the last data line).\n\n### Exact Output Template:\n```text\nSCAN_ID: <$BUILD_ID>\n-----BEGIN WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n<size>  <path>\n...\n-----END WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n\n-----BEGIN TODO_LINES-----\n<rel_path> [<line>] <content>\n...\n-----END TODO_LINES-----\nMD5: <32_char_hex_hash>\n```\n*(Note: There is exactly one blank line between the end of one section and the start of the next)*\n\n## 4. Console Output\nAfter writing the report, print a single line of valid JSON to stdout:\n`{\"status\": \"complete\", \"report_file\": \"<actual_path_written>\"}`\n\n## Summary of Traps & Constraints\n*   Do not hardcode paths; read the INI file.\n*   Respect the 10KB size limit for TODO scanning.\n*   Ensure correct sorting (Size DESC for files, Path ASC for TODOs).\n*   **Strictly enforce ISO-8859-1 encoding** with `?` replacement.\n*   Calculate the MD5 checksum over the generated content and append it.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@f20579cc-b850-49ba-a4ff-8d22f3d01ed2:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration.

You have just deployed an update to `/home/user/release` (or wherever the configuration specifies). You must generate a compliance report that meets the strict, archaic format requirements of the OldGuard system.\n\n## 1. Configuration\nUnlike modern tools, the scanner does not take command-line arguments. You must read the configuration from `/etc/oldguard/scanner.ini`. This file contains key-value pairs (e.g., `KEY = VALUE`).\n\n*   **ROOT_DIR**: The directory tree to scan.\n*   **REPORT_PATH**: The absolute path where the report must be saved.\n\n*Note: The configuration parser on the mainframe is robust against surrounding whitespace, so you should be too.*\n\n## 2. Scan Requirements\n\n### Part A: World-Writable Files\nIdentify all files in the `ROOT_DIR` tree that are **world-writable** (others have write permission). \n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   The mainframe sorts these entries by **File Size (Descending)**. If two files have the same size, sort them alphabetically by their absolute path.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH` (Note: Two spaces between size and path).\n\n**Exclusions:**\n*   Symbolic links.\n*   Files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n\n### Part B: TODO Comments\nSearch for the literal string \"TODO\" in source files.\n\n**Scope & Constraints:**\n*   Scan only files with extensions `.py` and `.log`.\n*   **Critical Constraint:** The mainframe has limited buffer memory. **Exclude any file larger than 10,240 bytes (10KB)** from this search entirely.\n*   Exclude symbolic links.\n*   Exclude files inside hidden directories (directories starting with `.`).\n*   Exclude any line containing the safety suppression token \"NO_FIX\" (case-sensitive).\n\n**Sorting & Formatting:**\n*   Sort hits alphabetically by the file's **relative path** from `ROOT_DIR`, then by line number ascending.\n*   Format each line exactly as: `RELATIVE_PATH [LINE_NUMBER] CONTENT`\n*   Preserve the content spacing exactly as found in the file, but strip the trailing newline.\n\n## 3. Report Format & Encoding (CRITICAL)\n\nThe OldGuard system predates UTF-8. The report file **MUST** be written using **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding.\n\n*   If a source file contains characters that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 (e.g., emojis, complex unicode), you **must** replace them with a literal question mark (`?`). Faiure to sanitise these characters will cause the mainframe ingest to crash.\n*   The file must start with the header: `SCAN_ID: <value of $BUILD_ID environment variable>`\n*   Use the exact section separators shown below.\n\n**Integrity Checksum:**\nTo ensure data integrity during transfer, the **very last line** of the report must be:\n`MD5: <checksum>`\n\nWhere `<checksum>` is the MD5 hex digest of the **entire file content preceding this line** (including the newline character of the last data line).\n\n### Exact Output Template:\n```text\nSCAN_ID: <$BUILD_ID>\n-----BEGIN WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n<size>  <path>\n...\n-----END WORLD_WRITABLE-----\n\n-----BEGIN TODO_LINES-----\n<rel_path> [<line>] <content>\n...\n-----END TODO_LINES-----\nMD5: <32_char_hex_hash>\n```\n*(Note: There is exactly one blank line between the end of one section and the start of the next)*\n\n## 4. Console Output\nAfter writing the report, print a single line of valid JSON to stdout:\n`{\"status\": \"complete\", \"report_file\": \"<actual_path_written>\"}`\n\n## Summary of Traps & Constraints\n*   Do not hardcode paths; read the INI file.\n*   Respect the 10KB size limit for TODO scanning.\n*   Ensure correct sorting (Size DESC for files, Path ASC for TODOs).\n*   **Strictly enforce ISO-8859-1 encoding** with `?` replacement.\n*   Calculate the MD5 checksum over the generated content and append it.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@f20579cc-b850-49ba-a4ff-8d22f3d01ed2:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
