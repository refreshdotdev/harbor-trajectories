  "analysis": "The report was successfully written to `${REPORT_PATH}` (which is `/home/user/audit/scan_report.dat`). The subsequent command to print the JSON status message executed, but it printed `{"status": "complete", "report_file": \"${REPORT_PATH}\"}` instead of `{"status": "complete", "report_file": \"/home/user/audit/scan_report.dat\"}`. This means the shell variable `REPORT_PATH` was not expanded within the string passed to the `echo` command, resulting in the literal string `\"${REPORT_PATH}\"` being part of the JSON. This is a malformed JSON status message as per the task requirements.",
  "plan": "Re-print the JSON status message, ensuring that the shell variable `REPORT_PATH` is correctly expanded within the JSON string. This can be achieved by placing the variable outside the quoted string for that specific part or by using a tool like `printf` for more robust formatting, though a simple correction of the `echo` command should suffice. The task should be marked complete after this correction.",
