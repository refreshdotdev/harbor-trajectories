  "analysis": "The `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH` variables have been set from the configuration file. Their current values can be verified. The next phase involves performing the scans. Part A requires finding world-writable files in `ROOT_DIR`, excluding symbolic links and files in hidden directories, sorting them by size (descending) and path (alphabetically), and formatting them as 'SIZE_IN_BYTES  ABSOLUTE_PATH'. Part B requires finding 'TODO' comments in `.py` and `.log` files (excluding those larger than 10KB), excluding links, hidden directories, and lines with 'NO_FIX', sorting by relative path and line number, and formatting as 'RELATIVE_PATH [LINE_NUMBER] CONTENT'.",
  "plan": "First, verify the values of `ROOT_DIR` and `REPORT_PATH`. Then, create the target directory for the report (`/home/user/audit`) if it doesn't already exist to prevent write errors later. After this, the script to perform Part A (world-writable files) will be constructed. This script will use `find` with appropriate options and then sort the results according to the specified criteria.",
