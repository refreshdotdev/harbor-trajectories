  "analysis": "The command to generate Part A content failed with the error 'find: ‘${ROOT_DIR}’: No such file or directory'. This indicates that the variable `${ROOT_DIR}` was not expanded as expected within the command substitution. The previous commands `ROOT_DIR=$(...)` and `echo \"ROOT_DIR is set to: '${ROOT_DIR}'\"` showed that the variable was correctly set and expanded. The issue likely lies in how the shell handles variable expansion within the `$()` construct when it's part of a larger assignment. The solution is to ensure the shell processes the command substitution with expanded variables, which might require using `eval` or by carefully structuring the command.",
  "plan": "Re-execute the Part A command, ensuring that the shell variables `${ROOT_DIR}` are expanded before `find` is called. This can be done by either wrapping the command substitution with `eval` or by using double quotes around the command string within the substitution. The `eval` approach will be used here. After successful execution, check if `PART_A_CONTENT` contains data.",
