It seems the redirects of errors from the numeric comparison (`2>/dev/null`) helped suppress the `integer expression expected` errors. The script may have skipped some files if their sizes couldn't be processed as integers, but it should have processed others. The output of this scan is in `tmp_report_part_B_final.txt`. The next step is to integrate this into the main report.",

Append the '-----END TODO_LINES-----' section separator after the TODO lines. 4. Append a blank line to `REPORT_CONTENT` to prepare for the checksum line. 5.
