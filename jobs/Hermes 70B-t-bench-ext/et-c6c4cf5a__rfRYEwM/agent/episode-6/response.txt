  "plan": "1. Use `find` to locate `.py` and `.log` files within `ROOT_DIR`, excluding symbolic links and files in hidden directories. 2. For each file, first check if its size is less than or equal to 10,240 bytes (10KB). 3. If the file is within the size limit, search for the literal string \"TODO\" in it. 4. Exclude lines containing the safety suppression token \"NO_FIX\" (case-sensitive). 5. For each match, format the output as `RELATIVE_PATH [LINE_NUMBER] CONTENT`, preserving original spacing but stripping trailing newlines. 6. Sort results alphabetically by relative path, then by line number ascending. 7. Append these formatted lines to `tmp_report_part_B.txt`.",
