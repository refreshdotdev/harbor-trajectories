The archive includes: .meta, january.csv, february.csv, config.json, march.csv, and latest.csv (symlink). I also set the modification time of the archive file to match the timestamp of the newest file contained within it (1577880000, which corresponds to January 1, 2020). The manifest file has been created but could use improved formatting.",
