The task requires me to create a sophisticated log filtering script called filter_errors.sh in /home/user/scripts with specific requirements for filtering, multi-line handling, redaction, CSV summary generation, and execution logging. The current state has no scripts directory or output directory yet.",
  "plan": "I will create the necessary directory structure and then implement the filter_errors.sh script in multiple stages. First I'll create the scripts directory and basic script structure. Then I'll implement the core filtering logic with multi-line handling using awk. After that I'll add email redaction functionality. Then I'll implement the CSV summary generation with proper categorization and sorting. Finally I'll add argument validation, output directory creation, and the execution logging functionality.",
