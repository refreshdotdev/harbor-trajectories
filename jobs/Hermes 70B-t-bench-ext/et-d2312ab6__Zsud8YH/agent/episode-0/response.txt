The task requires me to process a UTF-16LE encoded XML file, register information in a SQLite database, generate a legacy sync file with specific binary requirements, and create a modern JSON manifest. I need to locate the key file, extract metadata, compute cryptographic signatures, and create output files with precise formats and permissions.",
  "plan": "First, I will navigate to the correct workspace directory and check the structure. Then, I'll locate the signing key in `/etc/opt/keys/` and extract the necessary information from the UTF-16LE XML file. After that, I'll compute the required signatures and register the build in the SQLite database. Finally, I'll generate the legacy sync file and the modern manifest, setting appropriate permissions.",
