The task requires processing a UTF-16LE encoded XML file, extracting version information, getting a build timestamp, generating a cryptographic signature, registering data in an SQLite database, creating a legacy-compatible CSV-like file, and generating a JSON manifest.

I'll list the contents of the workspace and incoming directories to verify the presence of `build_meta.xml` and get its modification time for the Build Timestamp. Then I will attempt to parse the XML file to extract the version string.",
