You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
# Capacity Planning Automation - January 2023

You are tasked with generating the January 2023 capacity report. Unlike previous months, we are in the middle of a migration from our legacy mainframe systems to a modern cloud infrastructure. This means the input data is heterogeneous, and strict data hygiene protocols are now in effect.

## 1. Scope Definition

Do not simply scan the entire raw directory. We have deprecated several regions. You must read `/home/user/capacity/config/manifest.txt` to determine which subdirectories within `/home/user/capacity/raw/` are active. The manifest lists relative directory names (one per line). Ignore empty lines or lines starting with `#`.

## 2. Data Ingestion & format

Inside the active directories, identify files ending in `_202301.log`. You will encounter two types of systems:

*   **Legacy Systems**: Identified by the string `legacy` in the filename (e.g., `server_legacy_202301.log`).
    *   **Encoding**: These files are strictly **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1).
    *   **Format**: Metrics are always integers.
*   **Modern Systems**: All other files.
    *   **Encoding**: These are **UTF-8**, but may contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM) which must be handled gracefully.
    *   **Format**: Metrics are floating-point numbers.

Files must also be filtered by status. Only process files containing the exact line `meta_status: active`. The metric lines (CPU_USED, MEM_USED, DISK_USED) may appear in any order.

## 3. Normalization & Aggregation

Before averaging, you must normalize the data stream:
1.  **Rounding**: Convert all modern floating-point metrics to integers by rounding to the **nearest integer** (0.5 rounds up, e.g., 20.5 -> 21). Legacy integers require no rounding.
2.  **Noise Filtering**: Our sensors are noisy. Discard any normalized integer value that is strictly **less than 5** or strictly **greater than 95**.
3.  **Averaging**: Compute the arithmetic mean of the remaining valid values for each metric (CPU, MEM, DISK) across all valid files. Round the final average **down** to the nearest integer.

## 4. Output Pipeline

You must generate three distinct artifacts in `/home/user/capacity/reports/`. Note that the manager views these files on a Windows workstation, so **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)** line endings are mandatory for text files.

**Artifact A: Intermediate Data**
*   File: `intermediate.json`
*   Content: A flat JSON object mapping the metric names (keys: `AVG_CPU_USED`, `AVG_MEM_USED`, `AVG_DISK_USED`) to their calculated integer averages. Use compact formatting (no whitespace/newlines).

**Artifact B: The Summary Report**
*   File: `summary_202301.log`
*   Line Endings: **CRLF** (`\r\n`).
*   Content:
    1.  `AVG_CPU_USED=<val>`
    2.  `AVG_MEM_USED=<val>`
    3.  `AVG_DISK_USED=<val>`
    4.  `source_size=<bytes>` (where `<bytes>` is the exact file size of `intermediate.json` in bytes).

**Artifact C: Binary Checksum**
*   File: `checksum.bin`
*   Content: The **raw binary** MD5 digest (16 bytes) of the `summary_202301.log` file. Do not store the hex string; store the actual bytes.

## 5. Finalization

1.  Update the symlink `/home/user/capacity/latest` to point to `summary_202301.log` (absolute path).
2.  Append a strictly formatted line to `/home/user/capacity/operations.log`:
    `Publication 2023-01: <N> files, Checksum: <SHA256>`
    *   `<N>`: Total count of valid files processed.
    *   `<SHA256>`: The lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the **`checksum.bin`** file you just created.
    *   (Note: `operations.log` is a standard Linux log, so use standard LF line endings here).

**Constraints**:
*   No root privileges.
*   Standard Python 3 libraries are available.
*   Do not leave stray temporary files.
