  "analysis": "The current terminal session is active in /home/user. The task requires generating a January 2023 capacity report by processing data from specific subdirectories listed in a manifest file, handling legacy and modern file formats, normalizing and aggregating data, and producing three distinct output artifacts with specific formatting requirements. The initial state shows we are at the root of the user's home directory, ready to begin the process.",
  "plan": "I will begin by creating a temporary working directory to keep our intermediate files organized. Then, I'll navigate to the capacity planning directory and read the manifest file to determine which raw data directories to process. A Python script will be written to handle the data ingestion, normalization, and aggregation according to the specifications. Finally, I'll generate the required output artifacts and update the system state as required.",
