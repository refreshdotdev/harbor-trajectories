  "analysis": "The current terminal state shows a root shell in \"/home/user\". No prior work has been done for the January 2023 capacity report. The task requires reading a manifest file to identify active data directories, processing heterogeneous log files with specific encoding and format requirements, performing data normalization and aggregation, and generating three output files with particular formatting constraints (CRLF line endings, compact JSON, binary checksum). Finally, a symlink needs to be updated and a log entry appended.",
  "plan": "I will begin by navigating to the capacity working directory and examining the manifest file to identify which raw data directories are active. Then I'll create the necessary output directories if they don't exist. Next, I'll process the manifest to get the list of active directories. Finally, I'll prepare a Python script that will handle the main data processing pipeline: reading files based on manifest, parsing metrics, normalizing data, filtering noise, calculating averages, and generating the required output artifacts with proper formatting.",
