{
  "analysis": "The tickets directory contains two JSON files: `CR-1104-draft.json` and `CR-1104.json`. According to the task, I should only process the file that exactly matches the Ticket ID from the email, but since the email file is empty, I will assume that `CR-1104.json` is the official ticket file (ignoring the draft). However, like the email, these files also appear to be empty (0 bytes), which means I still lack the necessary configuration details and constraints.",
  "plan": "I will attempt to open and inspect the contents of `CR-1104.json` to confirm if it contains any usable data. If it remains empty, I will need to consider alternative approaches or report the missing data issue. The task requires specific values from the ticket JSON to update the configuration files, so without valid data, proceeding further would be risky.",
