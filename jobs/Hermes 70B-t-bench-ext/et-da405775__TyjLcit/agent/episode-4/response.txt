  "analysis": "As expected, the ticket file `CR-1104.json` is completely empty. This presents a major problem because all the required configuration details—such as the database host, port, password, connection settings, API gateway port, and CORS origins—are supposed to come from this JSON file. Additionally, the missing email would have provided critical constraints regarding file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols.",
  "plan": "Given that both the email and ticket files are empty, I must now make an informed decision on how to proceed. Since I cannot obtain the necessary data to perform the updates safely, I will attempt to extract any available configuration from the existing config files and also look for any additional information or documentation in the system. If no further information is found, I will halt the process and report the missing data issue.",
