  "analysis": "The CR-1104.json ticket file is also empty. This creates a significant problem as I don't have the necessary data values (host, port, password, etc.) required to update the configuration files. Without this data, I cannot complete the core responsibilities of the task. I need to find an alternative source for this configuration data or determine if there's a different ticket file available.",
  "plan": "I will double-check the tickets directory for any other JSON files that might contain the required configuration data. If no other files are found, I'll need to look for documentation or examples that might provide sample data values. As a last resort, I may need to create a placeholder ticket file with assumed values, clearly documenting this workaround and the risks involved. The priority is to obtain the necessary data inputs to proceed with the configuration updates.",
