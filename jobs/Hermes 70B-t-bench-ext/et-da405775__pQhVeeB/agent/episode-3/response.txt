  "analysis": "The ticket file `CR-1104.json` also appears to be empty. This means I have no information about the Ticket ID, nor the specific values needed to update the configuration files (host, port, password, connection_multiplier, connection_offset, server.port, security.cors.allowed_origins). More importantly, I'm missing the critical constraints from the email regarding file encodings, cross-file dependencies, and logging protocols.",
  "plan": "Given that both the email and the ticket file are empty, I cannot proceed with the task as described. I need to report this issue and request the correct files or information. I will first check if there are any other potentially relevant files in the system that might contain the necessary data or constraints.",
