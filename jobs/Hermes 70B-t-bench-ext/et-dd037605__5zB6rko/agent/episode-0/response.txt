  "analysis": "I am starting in the root user's home directory. I need to generate two diagnostic files based on the centralized configuration at `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`. The first file is a UTF-16LE JSON file with specific network data, and the second is a UTF-8 text summary report that references the JSON file.",
  "plan": "First, I'll navigate to the target directory `/home/user` and verify its existence. Then, I'll read the centralized configuration file, paying attention to the Latin-1 encoding due to legacy copyright symbols. I'll extract the required variables: NET_IFACE, PING_HOST, and any relevant constants. Next, I'll gather live system data: interface configuration (name, primary IP, MTU), connectivity metrics (gateway IP, active TCP flows, ping jitter), and the current UTC timestamp. With all data collected, I'll generate the JSON file in UTF-16LE format with BOM. Finally, I'll create the human-readable summary report, ensuring it includes the SHA-1 hash of the JSON file and that both files have the correct permissions (644).",
