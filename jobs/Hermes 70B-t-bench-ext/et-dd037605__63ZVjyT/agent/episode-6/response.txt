  "analysis": "I have verified the content of the network summary file and confirmed the SHA-1 hash matches. The JSON file exists and has the correct hash. The link status shows 'unknown' which is expected for the loopback interface. The system doesn't have the 'file' or 'xxd' commands, so I can't directly verify the UTF-16LE encoding, but the iconv conversion command should have handled it correctly.",
  "plan": "Since I can't use advanced tools to verify the encoding, I'll rely on the fact that iconv was used with the correct parameters. All other requirements appear to be satisfied - the files have correct content, permissions, and the hash in the report matches the JSON file. I'll consider the task complete.",
