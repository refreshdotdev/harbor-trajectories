  "analysis": "The terminal session is currently in the root user's home directory. No prior work has been done on this task yet. The plan is to: 1) Read the centralized Gamma cluster configuration file at /opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini (ignoring any user home directory config files), 2) Extract required parameters, 3) Gather live system network data, 4) Generate a UTF-16LE encoded JSON file with specific content, and 5) Create a corresponding human-readable summary report with a SHA-1 hash verification of the JSON file.",
  "plan": "First, I will inspect the centralized configuration file to understand its structure and extract the necessary parameters (NET_IFACE, PING_HOST). While the file is supposed to be ISO-8859-1 encoded, I'll examine it to confirm the encoding and ensure proper parsing. Then, I'll gather the required network data: interface name, primary IP, MTU, default gateway, active TCP flows, and ping jitter. After that, I'll generate the network_data.json file in UTF-16LE with BOM format, ensuring it's strictly valid JSON. Finally, I'll create the network_summary.txt report with the SHA-1 hash of the JSON file, set appropriate permissions on both files, and verify their contents.",
