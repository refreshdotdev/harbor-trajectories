      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Network Diagnostic & Serialization Task\n\nYou are taking over a legacy monitoring node integration task. The previous engineer left midway through the migration from a local configuration system to a centralized one. Your goal is to generate a structured diagnostic dataset and a human-readable summary report for the host located at `/home/user`.\n\n## Configuration Context\n\nThis host is part of the \"Gamma\" cluster. Unlike the alpha nodes which still use `/home/user/diag_config.conf`, all Gamma nodes have been migrated to the centralized configuration path at `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`. You must ignore any configuration files found in the user's home directory as they are stale decoys. \n\n**Warning:** The centralized configuration management system is legacy software (circa 1999) and saves files using the **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** character set. Attempting to parse this file as UTF-8 will result in errors due to legacy copyright symbols in the header comments.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\nYou must produce two distinct output files based on live system data. The generation order matters because one file references the other.\n\n### 1. The Machine-Readable Data\n\n**Path:** `/home/user/network_data.json`\n**Encoding:** UTF-16LE with Byte Order Mark (BOM)\n\nThis file must be a valid JSON object containing the following keys:\n\n*   `\"timestamp_utc\"`: Current UTC time in ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`).\n*   `\"interface_config\"`: An object containing:\n    *   `\"name\"`: The interface name specified in the configuration file variable `NET_IFACE`.\n    *   `\"primary_ip\"`: The first IPv4 address assigned to that interface (do not include CIDR prefix).\n    *   `\"mtu\"`: The integer MTU value of the interface.\n*   `\"connectivity\"`: An object containing:\n    *   `\"gateway_ip\"`: The default gateway address. If multiple exist, choose the one with the lowest metric. If none, `null`.\n    *   `\"active_tcp_flows\"`: Integer count of TCP sockets in the **ESTABLISHED** state only (ignore LISTEN, TIME-WAIT, etc.). Use `ss`.\n    *   `\"ping_jitter_ms\"`: The standard deviation (`mdev`) from a 5-count ping to the target specified in `PING_HOST` (from config). This must be a float rounded to exactly 3 decimal places.\n\n### 2. The Human-Readable Report\n\n**Path:** `/home/user/network_summary.txt`\n**Encoding:** UTF-8 (Standard)\n\nThis file serves as a verification sidecar. It must contain exactly these lines:\n\nLine 1: `GAMMA NODE DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY`\nLine 2: `Generated: <timestamp_utc>` (Must match the JSON timestamp exactly)\nLine 3: `Target Host: <PING_HOST>` (From config)\nLine 4: `Link Status: <UP or DOWN>` (Based on the operstate of `NET_IFACE`)\nLine 5: `Data Hash: <SHA-1 hash>`\n\n**Crucial:** The `Data Hash` in Line 5 must be the **SHA-1** hash of the binary content of the `network_data.json` file you generated. This ensures the integrity of the binary-encoded JSON file.\n\n## Constraints\n\n*   **Permissions:** Both output files must be mode `644`.\n*   **Environment:** Do not hardcode values. The script must dynamically read `/opt/monitoring/config/diagnostics.ini`.\n*   **Robustness:** The JSON file must be strictly valid. A trailing comma will cause ingestion failure. The encoding (UTF-16LE) is mandatory for the Windows-based ingestion service.\n\nWhen both files are present, valid, and consistent (hash matches, timestamps match), the task is complete.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@a61c4339-d4dc-46d3-923f-4eab9aad3d7a:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While the file is supposed to be ISO-8859-1 encoded, I'll examine it to confirm the encoding and ensure proper parsing. Then, I'll gather the required network data: interface name, primary IP, MTU, default gateway, active TCP flows, and ping jitter.
