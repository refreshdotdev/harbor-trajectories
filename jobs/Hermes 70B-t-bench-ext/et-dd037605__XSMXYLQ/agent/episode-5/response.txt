The ping jitter was set to 0.000 as the ping command didn't return a valid jitter value for localhost.\n2. network_summary.txt - Contains the human-readable report with matching timestamp, target host, link status, and SHA-1 hash of the JSON file.\n\nBoth files have been set to 644 permissions. The JSON file was converted to UTF-16LE encoding with BOM, and the SHA-1 hash has been verified and added to the report file.",
