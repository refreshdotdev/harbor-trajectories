You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
Context:
    You are a security-operations log analyst who has just received a batch of certificate “drop-ins”.  
    The certificates are scattered across various subdirectories. Each certificate is accompanied 
    by a one-line metadata file that contains its essential fields and a checksum.
    Your job is to triage the batch, identify valid certificates, detect errors/corruption, and 
    produce three artefacts for downstream monitoring.

    Starting state of the machine:
    1. Directory /home/user/certs_incoming/ exists and contains a nested hierarchy of subdirectories.
       Inside these directories are pairs of files:
       - *.crt (The certificate content)
       - *.meta (Metadata)

       Every *.meta file is a single line, pipe-delimited, with the following fixed field order:
       subject|issuer|not_before|not_after|sha256_checksum
       
       - The date fields are in ISO-8601 calendar form: YYYY-MM-DD.
       - The checksum is the SHA256 hash of the content of the corresponding *.crt file.

       Example line:
       CN=api.example.com|CN=Example-CA|2023-06-01|2024-12-31|a1b2c3d4...

    2. No other files or directories are present in /home/user/cert_analysis/ (you must create it).

    Required end state:
    After you finish, the system must contain the following three new artefacts inside 
    /home/user/cert_analysis/ :

    A.  /home/user/cert_analysis/expiring_certs.csv  
        • Include ONLY certificates that pass all validation checks (see below).
        • CSV header must be exactly:  
          filename,subject,issuer,not_before,not_after,days_until_expiry,status
        • days_until_expiry is calculated as (not_after – today) in integer days.
        • status logic:
          – “OK”              when days_until_expiry > 30
          – “EXPIRING_SOON”   when 0 <= days_until_expiry <= 30
          – “EXPIRED”         when days_until_expiry < 0
        • SORTING REQUIREMENT: The rows must be sorted by days_until_expiry in ASCENDING order 
          (lowest/negative numbers first).

    B.  /home/user/cert_analysis/analysis.log  
        • One log line per VALID processed certificate.
        • Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Processed <filename> - <status>

    C.  /home/user/cert_analysis/errors.json
        • A JSON file containing a list of objects representing files that failed validation.
        • Each object must have keys: "filename" (the .meta filename) and "reason".
        • Validation logic (check in this strict order):
          1. MISSING_CRT: The corresponding *.crt file does not exist.
          2. INVALID_DATE: The not_before or not_after fields are not valid YYYY-MM-DD dates.
          3. CHECKSUM_MISMATCH: The SHA256 hash of the *.crt file does not match the metadata checksum.
        • If a file fails validation, do NOT include it in the CSV or log file. Add it only to errors.json.
        • Example JSON content:
          [
            {"filename": "server_bad.meta", "reason": "CHECKSUM_MISMATCH"},
            {"filename": "server_ghost.meta", "reason": "MISSING_CRT"}
          ]

    Deliverables:
    1. /home/user/cert_analysis/expiring_certs.csv
    2. /home/user/cert_analysis/analysis.log
    3. /home/user/cert_analysis/errors.json
