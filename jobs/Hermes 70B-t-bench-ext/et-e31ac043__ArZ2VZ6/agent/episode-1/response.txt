I have also created the `secure_gnupg` directory and set its permissions to 700 as required for Protocol Omega compliance. The next step is to extract the PGP public key from `correspondence.mbox` and import it into this isolated GnuPG environment.",
  "plan": "1. Use gpg with its status-fd (file descriptor 3) in ASCII-armored output mode to extract all public keys from `correspondence.mbox` and write them to a temporary file `temp_keys.asc` within the `secure_gnupg` directory. 2. Configure the `GNUPGHOME` environment variable to point to the `secure_gnupg` directory for all subsequent GnuPG operations.",
