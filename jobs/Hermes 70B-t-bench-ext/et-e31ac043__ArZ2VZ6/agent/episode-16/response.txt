  "analysis": "All tasks specified in Protocol Omega have been successfully completed:\n1.  **Environment Isolation**: `secure_gnupg/` directory created with permissions `700`. `GNUPGHOME` was set.\n2.  **Identity Management**: Public keys were extracted from `correspondence.mbox` and imported into the isolated `secure_gnupg` keyring.\n3.  **Verification & Audit Logging**: Signature `message.txt.sig` was successfully verified against `message.txt`. The `verification_audit.json` file was created with the correct status (`valid`), signer fingerprint (`833207f7686632a1a3bb7d2204a579d91dc753c9`), and signature timestamp (`2026-02-13T15:16:37Z`).\n4.  **Payload Archival & Derived Encryption**: The `message.txt` file was parsed to extract `X-Correlation-ID` and `amount`. The encryption passphrase (`445566778899-7331-efac-feeb-11225588-4650`) was correctly derived. `message.txt` was symmetrically encrypted using AES256 into `payload.encrypted` (original file remains untouched).\n5.  **Integrity Manifest**: The `archival_manifest.chk` file was generated, containing the SHA256 checksum and filename of `payload.encrypted` in the correct format.\n\nAll deliverables are present and compliant with the specifications.",
