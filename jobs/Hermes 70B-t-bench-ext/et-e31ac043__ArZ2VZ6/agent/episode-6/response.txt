  "analysis": "I encountered an error with the GnuPG command: `gpg: Note: '--status-fd=2' is not considered an option`. This indicates that the version of GnuPG available in this environment does not support the `--status-fd` option, which is crucial for the structured output format recommended by Protocol Omega. I need to confirm the GnuPG version and then find an alternative way to reliably extract the required information. The most common alternative for older GnuPG versions is to use `--logger-fd` for ASCII-armored status messages.",
  "plan": "1. Check the GnuPG version to understand its capabilities. 2. Attempt to use `--logger-fd=1` with `--verbose` to get ASCII-armored status messages which I can then parse for the signer's fingerprint and timestamp. 3. If this is successful, I will use the extracted information to populate the `verification_audit.json` file.",
