  "analysis": "It seems the GnuPG version 2.2.27 in this environment also does not support `--logger-fd` as an option, or I am using the syntax incorrectly. I need to revert to a more basic verification command first to see if the signature can be validated at all, and then I must find a way to parse the human-readable output to extract the signer's fingerprint and timestamp. This is a fallback from the preferred structured output methods.",
  "plan": "1. Run a standard `gpg --verify` command to check if the signature is valid and to get some human-readable output. 2. From this output, I will try to manually identify the signer's fingerprint and the signature timestamp. 3. Once I have this information, I can construct the `verification_audit.json` file.",
