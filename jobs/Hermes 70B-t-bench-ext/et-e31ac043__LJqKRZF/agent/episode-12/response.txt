  "analysis": "The passphrase `445566778899-7331-efac-feeb-11225588-4650` has been correctly derived according to the Protocol Omega specifications. The next step is to use this passphrase to symmetrically encrypt `message.txt` for archival. The output file must be named `payload.encrypted` and use AES256 as the cipher. The original `message.txt` must remain unmodified.",
  "plan": "Use `gpg` for symmetric encryption with AES256. The passphrase will be provided via a pipe to avoid command-line history exposure. `message.txt` will be the input, and `payload.encrypted` will be the output.",
