  "analysis": "The `gpg --verify` command with `--status-fd` has completed and its output was redirected to `gpg_verify_status.txt`. This file should contain the colon-delimited status codes from GnuPG, which are crucial for accurately determining the signature's validity and for extracting the required details like the signer's fingerprint and signature timestamp for the audit log.",
  "plan": "1. Display the content of `gpg_verify_status.txt`. 2. Parse the colon-delimited lines to find: a) A `SIG_ID` line to get the full fingerprint of the signing key. b) A `VALIDSIG` line to confirm successful verification and get the signature timestamp. c) An `ERRSIG` or `BADSIG` line if verification failed. The output of `gpg` to stderr (now in the same file) might also contain human-readable messages like 'Good signature'.",
