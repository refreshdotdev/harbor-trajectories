  "analysis": "The signature verification was successful! `gpg --verify` confirmed that the signature on `message.txt` is `Good` and was made by the key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` (Partner Bank (Omega)). The signature timestamp is `Fri 13 Feb 2026 06:51:00 PM UTC`. The primary key fingerprint is `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC`. This matches the key I configured for trust. The warnings about trust are expected as this is a new, isolated keyring.",
  "plan": "Now that verification is complete and I have the necessary details (status, fingerprint, timestamp), I will create the `verification_audit.json` file with this information. After that, I'll proceed to derive the encryption passphrase from `message.txt`, encrypt the payload, and generate the integrity manifest.",
