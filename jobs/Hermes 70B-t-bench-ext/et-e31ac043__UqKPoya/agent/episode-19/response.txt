  "analysis": "The passphrase was successfully derived: `445566778899-7331-efac-feeb-11225588-4650`. The `gpg --symmetric` command was executed to encrypt `message.txt` into `payload.encrypted` using AES256 and the derived passphrase. The command prompt was returned, indicating the encryption process is likely complete. I need to verify the existence and integrity of the `payload.encrypted` file.",
  "plan": "I will check if `payload.encrypted` was created. Then, I will generate the SHA256 checksum for `payload.encrypted` and create the `archival_manifest.chk` file in the standard `sha256sum` output format. Finally, I will list all files in the directory to confirm all deliverables are present and original files are untouched.",
