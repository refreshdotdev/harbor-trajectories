  "analysis": "The terminal is still in the `gpg --edit-key` interactive session, so my `quit` command, `export GNUPGHOME`, and `gpg --verify` commands were interpreted as inputs to `gpg --edit-key` rather than new shell commands. I need to ensure I fully exit this interactive session.",
  "plan": "I will try to exit the `gpg --edit-key` session by typing `quit` again. If this doesn't work, I will try the `Ctrl+C` escape sequence to terminate the `gpg --edit-key` process and return to the shell prompt. Once back in the shell, I will re-export `GNUPGHOME` and attempt the verification again.",
