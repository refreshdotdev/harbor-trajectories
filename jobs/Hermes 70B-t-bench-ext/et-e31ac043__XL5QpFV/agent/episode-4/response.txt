  "analysis": "The signature has been successfully verified as 'Good' using the key `A971E5ED0E9B791510E03A050EC25A81416512CC` (Partner Bank (Omega)). The warning about the key not being certified with a trusted signature is expected as it was just imported. For Protocol Omega compliance, we need the signer's fingerprint and signature timestamp. The output provides the primary key fingerprint. I will now use `gpg --list-packets` to extract the detailed signature creation timestamp in a parsable format.",
  "plan": "I will use `gpg --list-packets` on the detached signature to get machine-readable details about the signature. This command will provide the signature creation timestamp, which I will need for the `verification_audit.json` file. I will filter for the `sig_timestamp` field.",
