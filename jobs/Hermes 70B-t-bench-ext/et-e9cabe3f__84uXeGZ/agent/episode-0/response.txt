  "analysis": "The task requires generating three firewall-related files based on a base rules file and a dynamically selected configuration file. The process involves data normalization, rule generation with specific logic, and creation of a strictly formatted audit manifest. The current state is a fresh terminal session with no prior work done.",
  "plan": "I will begin by navigating to the working directory and examining the available configuration files to identify the most recently modified JSON file. Then I'll process the base rules file, normalize the data, and generate the intermediate JSON file. After that, I'll create the final optimized rules file and finally produce the audit manifest with the required special formatting.",
