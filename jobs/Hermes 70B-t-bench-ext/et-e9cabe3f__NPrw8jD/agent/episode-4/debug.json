            "content": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Firewall Lockdown Simulation: Advanced Compliance\n\nYou are a Senior Security Engineer tasked with generating a compliant `iptables-save` configuration for a legacy financial gateway. This task simulates a \"dry-run\" preparation of configuration files. You must produce three specific artifacts: an intermediate data structure, the final rules file, and a strictly formatted audit manifest.\n\n## 1. Input Analysis & Discovery\n\n### The Base Rules\nA snapshot of the current firewall state is located at `/home/user/firewall/base_rules.v4`. \n**Critical Context**: This file was exported from a Windows-based bastion host. Consequently, it uses Windows-style line endings (CRLF). Your processing pipeline must handle this correctly to ensure the final output uses standard Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### The Configuration Policy\nThe security policy is managed dynamically. You will find a directory of configuration files at `/home/user/firewall/configs/`. \n\n**Requirement**: You must identify and use the **single most recently modified** JSON file in this directory as your source of truth. Ignore all older files.\n\n**Data Sanitization Warning**: The upstream Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is known to inject typesetting artifacts into string values. Specifically, IP addresses often contain invisible Zero Width Spaces (`\\u200b`) which cause firewall loading failures. You **must** sanitize all configuration values by stripping non-printable characters before use.\n\nThe configuration file defines:\n*   `trusted_ip`: The source IP allowed to access restricted ports.\n*   `allow_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to ACCEPT. These may be single integers (e.g., \"80\") or hyphenated inclusive ranges (e.g., \"8080-8085\"). You must expand all ranges into individual rules.\n*   `block_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to DROP. Ranges are also possible here.\n\n## 2. Processing Pipeline\n\nYou must implement a multi-stage generation process. The output of one stage is the input or verification key for the next.\n\n### Stage 1: Normalization & Intermediate State\nParse the base rules and the active configuration. Create a normalized list of rule objects. \nYou must save this structured data to `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`. This file should be a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a rule to be applied.\n\n### Stage 2: Final Rule Generation (`optimized_rules.v4`)\nGenerate the final iptables file `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4` based on the following logic:\n1.  **Default Policies**: Set INPUT and FORWARD to DROP. Set OUTPUT to ACCEPT.\n2.  **State Preservation**: The `base_rules.v4` file contains a rule for `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` traffic. You must identify and preserve this rule as the **very first** rule after the policy definitions.\n3.  **Allow Rules**: For every port in the expanded `allow_ports` list, create a rule ACCEPTing TCP traffic from the `trusted_ip`.\n4.  **Drop Rules**: For every port in the expanded `block_ports` list, create a rule DROPPing TCP traffic from any source.\n5.  **Sorting**: To prevent rule shadowing and ensure determinism, all ACCEPT and DROP rules (excluding the state rule) must be sorted by **destination port number** in ascending numeric order. If a port has both an ACCEPT and a DROP rule (e.g. specific allow vs general drop), the ACCEPT rule must come first.\n6.  **Formatting**: The file must start with `*filter` and end with `COMMIT`. Use Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### Stage 3: The Audit Manifest (`audit_manifest.csv`)\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`. \n\n**Compliance Standards**: \nDue to integration with a legacy SIEM system, this file has strict binary requirements:\n1.  **Encoding**: The file **MUST** be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). It must NOT be UTF-8.\n2.  **Delimiter**: Use the pipe character (`|`) as the column delimiter, not commas.\n3.  **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `timestamp|action|detail`\n\n**Content Requirements**:\n*   `timestamp`: ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2025-03-01T14:05:33`).\n*   `action`: One of `added`, `removed`, or `changed`.\n*   `detail`: A description of the change. \n    *   **Special Requirement**: If the `action` is `changed` (e.g., changing default policies), the `detail` string must start with the section sign character (`\u00a7`) followed by the policy name. Example: `\u00a7INPUT policy set to DROP`.\n\n**Footer Verification**:\nThe last two lines of the manifest must be verification checkpoints:\n*   The second-to-last line must be: `Check: <MD5_hash_of_intermediate.json>`\n*   The very last line must be: `Bytes: <Byte_count_of_optimized_rules.v4>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\nWhen finished, the following files must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`\n2.  `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4`\n3.  `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`\n\n**Note**: Do not attempt to load these rules into the kernel; only generate the files.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@38cc7097-ace1-487c-a838-1f4658c2bc86:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Firewall Lockdown Simulation: Advanced Compliance\n\nYou are a Senior Security Engineer tasked with generating a compliant `iptables-save` configuration for a legacy financial gateway. This task simulates a \"dry-run\" preparation of configuration files. You must produce three specific artifacts: an intermediate data structure, the final rules file, and a strictly formatted audit manifest.\n\n## 1. Input Analysis & Discovery\n\n### The Base Rules\nA snapshot of the current firewall state is located at `/home/user/firewall/base_rules.v4`. \n**Critical Context**: This file was exported from a Windows-based bastion host. Consequently, it uses Windows-style line endings (CRLF). Your processing pipeline must handle this correctly to ensure the final output uses standard Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### The Configuration Policy\nThe security policy is managed dynamically. You will find a directory of configuration files at `/home/user/firewall/configs/`. \n\n**Requirement**: You must identify and use the **single most recently modified** JSON file in this directory as your source of truth. Ignore all older files.\n\n**Data Sanitization Warning**: The upstream Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is known to inject typesetting artifacts into string values. Specifically, IP addresses often contain invisible Zero Width Spaces (`\\u200b`) which cause firewall loading failures. You **must** sanitize all configuration values by stripping non-printable characters before use.\n\nThe configuration file defines:\n*   `trusted_ip`: The source IP allowed to access restricted ports.\n*   `allow_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to ACCEPT. These may be single integers (e.g., \"80\") or hyphenated inclusive ranges (e.g., \"8080-8085\"). You must expand all ranges into individual rules.\n*   `block_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to DROP. Ranges are also possible here.\n\n## 2. Processing Pipeline\n\nYou must implement a multi-stage generation process. The output of one stage is the input or verification key for the next.\n\n### Stage 1: Normalization & Intermediate State\nParse the base rules and the active configuration. Create a normalized list of rule objects. \nYou must save this structured data to `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`. This file should be a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a rule to be applied.\n\n### Stage 2: Final Rule Generation (`optimized_rules.v4`)\nGenerate the final iptables file `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4` based on the following logic:\n1.  **Default Policies**: Set INPUT and FORWARD to DROP. Set OUTPUT to ACCEPT.\n2.  **State Preservation**: The `base_rules.v4` file contains a rule for `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` traffic. You must identify and preserve this rule as the **very first** rule after the policy definitions.\n3.  **Allow Rules**: For every port in the expanded `allow_ports` list, create a rule ACCEPTing TCP traffic from the `trusted_ip`.\n4.  **Drop Rules**: For every port in the expanded `block_ports` list, create a rule DROPPing TCP traffic from any source.\n5.  **Sorting**: To prevent rule shadowing and ensure determinism, all ACCEPT and DROP rules (excluding the state rule) must be sorted by **destination port number** in ascending numeric order. If a port has both an ACCEPT and a DROP rule (e.g. specific allow vs general drop), the ACCEPT rule must come first.\n6.  **Formatting**: The file must start with `*filter` and end with `COMMIT`. Use Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### Stage 3: The Audit Manifest (`audit_manifest.csv`)\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`. \n\n**Compliance Standards**: \nDue to integration with a legacy SIEM system, this file has strict binary requirements:\n1.  **Encoding**: The file **MUST** be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). It must NOT be UTF-8.\n2.  **Delimiter**: Use the pipe character (`|`) as the column delimiter, not commas.\n3.  **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `timestamp|action|detail`\n\n**Content Requirements**:\n*   `timestamp`: ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2025-03-01T14:05:33`).\n*   `action`: One of `added`, `removed`, or `changed`.\n*   `detail`: A description of the change. \n    *   **Special Requirement**: If the `action` is `changed` (e.g., changing default policies), the `detail` string must start with the section sign character (`\u00a7`) followed by the policy name. Example: `\u00a7INPUT policy set to DROP`.\n\n**Footer Verification**:\nThe last two lines of the manifest must be verification checkpoints:\n*   The second-to-last line must be: `Check: <MD5_hash_of_intermediate.json>`\n*   The very last line must be: `Bytes: <Byte_count_of_optimized_rules.v4>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\nWhen finished, the following files must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`\n2.  `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4`\n3.  `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`\n\n**Note**: Do not attempt to load these rules into the kernel; only generate the files.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@38cc7097-ace1-487c-a838-1f4658c2bc86:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Firewall Lockdown Simulation: Advanced Compliance\n\nYou are a Senior Security Engineer tasked with generating a compliant `iptables-save` configuration for a legacy financial gateway. This task simulates a \"dry-run\" preparation of configuration files. You must produce three specific artifacts: an intermediate data structure, the final rules file, and a strictly formatted audit manifest.\n\n## 1. Input Analysis & Discovery\n\n### The Base Rules\nA snapshot of the current firewall state is located at `/home/user/firewall/base_rules.v4`. \n**Critical Context**: This file was exported from a Windows-based bastion host. Consequently, it uses Windows-style line endings (CRLF). Your processing pipeline must handle this correctly to ensure the final output uses standard Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### The Configuration Policy\nThe security policy is managed dynamically. You will find a directory of configuration files at `/home/user/firewall/configs/`. \n\n**Requirement**: You must identify and use the **single most recently modified** JSON file in this directory as your source of truth. Ignore all older files.\n\n**Data Sanitization Warning**: The upstream Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is known to inject typesetting artifacts into string values. Specifically, IP addresses often contain invisible Zero Width Spaces (`\\u200b`) which cause firewall loading failures. You **must** sanitize all configuration values by stripping non-printable characters before use.\n\nThe configuration file defines:\n*   `trusted_ip`: The source IP allowed to access restricted ports.\n*   `allow_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to ACCEPT. These may be single integers (e.g., \"80\") or hyphenated inclusive ranges (e.g., \"8080-8085\"). You must expand all ranges into individual rules.\n*   `block_ports`: A list of strings defining ports to DROP. Ranges are also possible here.\n\n## 2. Processing Pipeline\n\nYou must implement a multi-stage generation process. The output of one stage is the input or verification key for the next.\n\n### Stage 1: Normalization & Intermediate State\nParse the base rules and the active configuration. Create a normalized list of rule objects. \nYou must save this structured data to `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`. This file should be a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a rule to be applied.\n\n### Stage 2: Final Rule Generation (`optimized_rules.v4`)\nGenerate the final iptables file `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4` based on the following logic:\n1.  **Default Policies**: Set INPUT and FORWARD to DROP. Set OUTPUT to ACCEPT.\n2.  **State Preservation**: The `base_rules.v4` file contains a rule for `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` traffic. You must identify and preserve this rule as the **very first** rule after the policy definitions.\n3.  **Allow Rules**: For every port in the expanded `allow_ports` list, create a rule ACCEPTing TCP traffic from the `trusted_ip`.\n4.  **Drop Rules**: For every port in the expanded `block_ports` list, create a rule DROPPing TCP traffic from any source.\n5.  **Sorting**: To prevent rule shadowing and ensure determinism, all ACCEPT and DROP rules (excluding the state rule) must be sorted by **destination port number** in ascending numeric order. If a port has both an ACCEPT and a DROP rule (e.g. specific allow vs general drop), the ACCEPT rule must come first.\n6.  **Formatting**: The file must start with `*filter` and end with `COMMIT`. Use Unix line endings (LF).\n\n### Stage 3: The Audit Manifest (`audit_manifest.csv`)\nCreate a log file at `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`. \n\n**Compliance Standards**: \nDue to integration with a legacy SIEM system, this file has strict binary requirements:\n1.  **Encoding**: The file **MUST** be encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). It must NOT be UTF-8.\n2.  **Delimiter**: Use the pipe character (`|`) as the column delimiter, not commas.\n3.  **Header**: The first line must be exactly: `timestamp|action|detail`\n\n**Content Requirements**:\n*   `timestamp`: ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2025-03-01T14:05:33`).\n*   `action`: One of `added`, `removed`, or `changed`.\n*   `detail`: A description of the change. \n    *   **Special Requirement**: If the `action` is `changed` (e.g., changing default policies), the `detail` string must start with the section sign character (`\u00a7`) followed by the policy name. Example: `\u00a7INPUT policy set to DROP`.\n\n**Footer Verification**:\nThe last two lines of the manifest must be verification checkpoints:\n*   The second-to-last line must be: `Check: <MD5_hash_of_intermediate.json>`\n*   The very last line must be: `Bytes: <Byte_count_of_optimized_rules.v4>`\n\n## Summary of Deliverables\nWhen finished, the following files must exist:\n1.  `/home/user/firewall/intermediate.json`\n2.  `/home/user/firewall/optimized_rules.v4`\n3.  `/home/user/firewall/audit_manifest.csv`\n\n**Note**: Do not attempt to load these rules into the kernel; only generate the files.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@38cc7097-ace1-487c-a838-1f4658c2bc86:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
