  "plan": "My first step is to check for any existing lock files in /tmp and remove them. Then, I will inspect the service script (`/opt/backup/service.py`) to identify the environment variable used for port configuration. After that, I will start the service with the correct port (9090) and ensure it's listening on `0.0.0.0:9090`. I will also check if the service is actually running.",
