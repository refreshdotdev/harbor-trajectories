The `grep` commands for finding port configuration in the service script yielded no output, which is unexpected; I need to inspect the script more thoroughly. The service was started with `PORT=9090 python3 /opt/backup/service.py` but it appears to have exited immediately, as indicated by `[1]+  Done` and `pgrep` confirming it's not running. The `ss` command is not available on this system.",
  "plan": "I will attempt to find the port configuration by inspecting the service script more directly. I'll use `grep` to search for common patterns like `int(os.environ.get('PORT')` or `argv` if it's using `argparse` or `sys.argv` for port configuration. I will also try to run the service script in a way that might reveal its expected command-line arguments or environment variables, or simply get it running.",
