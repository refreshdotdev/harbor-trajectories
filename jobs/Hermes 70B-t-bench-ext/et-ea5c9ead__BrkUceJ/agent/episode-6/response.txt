The service is still not running, and I need to get it started on port 9090. The previous attempts to debug the service script directly were hampered by the shell state.",
  "plan": "I will first check if the service script is still modified from the previous attempt. I'll then revert to the backup if needed. After that, I'll try to start the service script with explicit port and host environment variables, using `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` for immediate output. I'll also check if there are any common dependencies like `gunicorn` or `waitress` that might be expected for running the service.",
