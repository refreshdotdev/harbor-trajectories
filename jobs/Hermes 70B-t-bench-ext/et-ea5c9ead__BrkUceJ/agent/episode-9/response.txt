  "analysis": "The critical issue is now clear: `/opt/backup/service.py` is an **empty file** (0 lines). This explains why it produces no output and exits immediately. The `file` command was not found, but `head` and `cat` confirmed the file is empty. The service cannot be started because there's no code in it. This is a blocker for the entire task which requires interacting with a running service.",
  "plan": "Since the service script is empty, I cannot proceed with starting it or performing the health checks as described in the task. I must investigate if there's a typo in the script's path or if the file was supposed to have content but is missing. I will check if there are other `service.py` files or similar scripts in the `/opt/backup/` directory or its parent directories. If no valid script is found, I will report this as a critical issue that prevents task completion.",
