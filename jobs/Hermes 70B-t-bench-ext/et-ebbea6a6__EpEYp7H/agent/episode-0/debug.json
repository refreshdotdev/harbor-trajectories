Its value is determined by the environment variable `POLICY_TLS` (defaulting to \u201ctrue\u201d if unset). The check is case-insensitive.\n    b.  **Logging**: In section `[logging]`, the key `level` **must** be present. Its value is determined by the environment variable `POLICY_LOG` (defaulting to \u201cINFO\u201d if unset). More restrictive levels (\u201cWARN\u201d, \u201cERROR\u201d, \u201cFATAL\u201d) are also acceptable. Anything more verbose (e.g. \u201cDEBUG\u201d, \u201cTRACE\u201d) is non-compliant.\n    c.  **Network**: In section `[network]`, the key `trusted_hosts` (if present) must contain **only** hostnames ending in `.corp.local`. The value is a comma-separated list. You must remove any non-compliant hostnames. If the list becomes empty, set the value to empty. If the key or section is missing, do not add it.\n\n3.  Remediate every non-compliant setting **in-place** while keeping formatting and comments intact:\n    *   If a required key is missing, add it.\n    *   If a required key exists with the wrong value, replace the value.\n    *   For `trusted_hosts`, filter the list as described.\n    *   Do **not** alter already-compliant keys.\n    *   Create a backup of each file you modify by appending the extension \u201c.bak\u201d (e.g. `app1.ini.bak`).\n        *   **Crucial**: The backup file must have permissions set to **0400** (read-only, owner only) and must retain the ownership (user:group) of the original file.\n    *   Do not generate backup files for already-compliant INIs.\n\n4.  Produce a single human-readable remediation log at `/home/user/policy/reports/after_remediation.log`.\n    The file must be created (and overwritten if it exists).

My task is to locate, assess, and remediate INI configuration files under `/home/user/policy/configs` based on specific corporate policies, create backups, and generate a detailed remediation log.\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"First, I need to set up the directory structure. I'll create `/home/user/policy/configs` for the INI files and `/home/user/policy/reports` for the log file. Then, I'll define the policy values as environment variables (`POLICY_TLS` and `POLICY_LOG`) based on the problem description. Since the task requires concurrent processing and advanced text manipulation, I'll use a Bash script. I'll write this script to `/home/user/policy/reports/ini_compliance.sh` and make it executable. This script will handle file discovery, hashing, policy checking, in-place remediation, compliant backup creation, and log generation. After writing the script, I will execute it. The script is designed to perform all the required checks and remediations concurrently and then produce the final sorted log.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p /home/user/policy/configs /home/user/policy/reports\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"export POLICY_TLS=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"export POLICY_LOG=\\\\\\\"INFO\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > /home/user/policy/reports/ini_compliance.sh << 'EOF'\\\\n#!/bin/bash\\\\n\\\\n# Exit on error or unset variable\\\\nset -euo pipefail\\\\n\\\\nBASE_DIR=\\\\\\\"/home/user/policy/configs\\\\\\\"\\\\nLOG_DIR=\\\\\\\"/home/user/policy/reports\\\\\\\"\\\\nFINAL_LOG_FILE=\\\\\\\"${LOG_DIR}/after_remediation.log\\\\\\\"\\\\nTLS_POLICY=\\\\\\\"${POLICY_TLS:-true}\\\\\\\"\\\\nLOG_POLICY=\\\\\\\"${POLICY_LOG:-INFO}\\\\\\\"\\\\nCOMPLIANT_LOG_LEVELS=(INFO WARN ERROR FATAL)\\\\nDESIRED_SECTION_ORDER=(\\\\\\\"security\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"logging\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"network\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n# Helper functions\\\\nlog_info() {\\\\n  echo \\\\\\\"[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n# 1.
