      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are an on\u2013call operations engineer who has been paged because \u201csome internal and public hostnames are not resolving for application pods\u201d. There is a **mock** name-service setup under your non-privileged account. Your task is to triage the incident and leave an auditable trail of what you did.\n\n### INPUT MATERIAL (already present in the home directory)\n*   `/home/user/incidents/tickets/dns_incident_2024.txt`\n    *   ASCII text, one hostname per line, no blank lines.\n*   `/home/user/resources/mock_hosts`\n    *   Works exactly like the traditional /etc/hosts file.\n    *   Fields are whitespace-separated.\n*   `/home/user/resources/dns/internal_dns.json`\n    *   **Primary** DNS source. JSON object.\n*   `/home/user/resources/dns/external_dns.json`\n    *   **Secondary** DNS source. JSON object.\n\n**DNS JSON Format:**\nKeys are hostnames. Values are objects containing either:\n*   `\"A\"` and `\"AAAA\"` keys (IP addresses).\n*   **OR** a `\"CNAME\"` key (alias to another hostname).\n\n### WHAT YOU MUST DO\n1.  **Read Hostnames**: Read every hostname from the ticket file.\n\n2.  **Resolution Logic**: For each hostname, determine its status:\n    *   **Check `mock_hosts`**: Look up the hostname here first.\n    *   **Check DNS**: If the hostname is not in `mock_hosts` (or to verify consistency), resolve it using the JSON files.\n        *   **Precedence**: Look in `internal_dns.json` first. If not found, look in `external_dns.json`.\n        *   **CNAMEs**: If a record contains a `\"CNAME\"` key, you must recursively resolve the target hostname using the same DNS precedence rules. Support a maximum recursion depth of **3**. If the chain exceeds 3 or loops, treat it as \"no record\".\n        *   **Result**: The final resolution is the `\"A\"` and `\"AAAA\"` values of the final target.\n\n3.  **Update Hosts File**: If a hostname has **no entry** in `mock_hosts` but **does** resolve to a non-empty IPv4 (`\"A\"`) via DNS (after following any CNAMEs), append a new line to `/home/user/resources/mock_hosts`:\n    `<Resolved_IPv4><tab><Original_Hostname>`\n\n4.  **Generate Report**: Produce a **sorted** tab-separated log file `/home/user/incidents/dns_resolution_report.log`.\n    *   **Sorting**: The lines must be sorted alphabetically by `HOSTNAME`.\n    *   **Columns** (Tab-separated):\n        1.  `HOSTNAME` (from ticket)\n        2.  `HOSTS_FILE_IP` (IP from `mock_hosts` or \u201c-\u201d)\n        3.  `DNS_IPV4` (Resolved \u201cA\u201d from JSON or \u201c-\u201d)\n        4.  `DNS_IPV6` (Resolved \u201cAAAA\u201d from JSON or \u201c-\u201d)\n        5.  `SUMMARY` (Exact phrase required):\n            *   `OK - hosts entry present, no DNS` (In hosts, not in DNS)\n            *   `OK - consistent` (In hosts and DNS, IPv4 matches)\n            *   `WARN - inconsistent` (In hosts and DNS, but IPv4 differs)\n            *   `UPDATED hosts with DNS A` (Not in hosts, found in DNS)\n            *   `NO RECORD FOUND` (In neither)\n\n### SUCCESS CRITERIA\n*   Log file exists, is UTF-8, and permissions are `0640` (rw-r-----).\n*   Log file content is **sorted alphabetically** by hostname.\n*   `mock_hosts` is updated correctly with resolved IPs for new hosts.\n*   CNAME chains are followed correctly to find the final IP.\n*   Internal DNS takes precedence over External DNS.\n*   The `WARN - inconsistent` state is correctly identified.\n\n### IMPORTANT\n*   Use only the provided files. Do not query real DNS.\n*   Do not modify the JSON files.\n*   Do not use root privileges.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@5a68cb8c-c175-4dd7-94d2-081b31720d99:~#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
