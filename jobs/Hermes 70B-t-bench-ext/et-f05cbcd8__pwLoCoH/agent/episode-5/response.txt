It seems the script creation process or the script itself has issues. Let's check the script content and then try to run it.

```json
{
  "analysis": "The script `resolve_dns.sh` was found with a syntax error: `resolve_dns.sh: line 7: syntax error near unexpected token '}'`. This indicates an issue in the script's structure, likely from the complex `cat >>` operations. `jq` is installed, which is a good sign. I need to inspect the script's beginning to find the syntax error and then attempt to run it.",
  "plan": "1. Use `head` to view the beginning of the `resolve_dns.sh` script to identify the syntax error around line 7. 2. If the script is too malformed to fix easily, I have two options: a) Attempt a quick fix if the error is obvious. b) Since the problem is to demonstrate the process, and the script creation was error-prone in this environment, I will try to run the script as is, or with a minor patch if possible, to see if it can proceed. The main goal is to generate the report and update mock_hosts.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "head -20 resolve_dns.sh\n",
      "duration": 0.3
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "bash resolve_dns.sh\n",
      "duration": 2.0
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": false
}
