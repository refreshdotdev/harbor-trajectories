Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why?

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Task: FinOps Q3 Data Migration & Mainframe Feed\n\n**Context**\nYou are a backend engineer tasked with fixing the broken cost reporting pipeline for Q3. The previous engineer left abruptly. We have a raw dump of weekly cloud costs, but the data pipeline needs to be reconstructed to support both our modern dashboard (JSON) and the legacy banking mainframe (CSV).\n\n**Input Data & Environment**\n*   **Raw Data**: Located at `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`. \n    *   *Warning*: This file comes from the legacy scrape tool. It is **NOT** UTF-8. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). You must handle this encoding correctly or the currency symbols will be corrupted.\n*   **Exchange Rates**: \n    *   There is a config file at `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/exchange_rates.json`. **IGNORE THIS FILE.** It contains Q1 rates and will cause financial discrepancies. \n    *   The authoritative rates are provided by the Finance team in a CSV file located at `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`.\n*   **Blocked Accounts**: `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/blocked_accounts.txt`. Accounts listed here must be excluded. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored.\n\n**Required Artefacts**\n\nYou must generate exactly four files in `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/`. The pipeline is strictly sequential.\n\n### Step 1: Normalization\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/normalized_data.json`.\n*   Read the raw ISO-8859-1 data and save it as standard **UTF-8** JSON.\n*   Ensure all monetary values are numbers, not strings.\n*   This file serves as the \"source of truth\" for the downstream steps.\n\n### Step 2: Audit Checkpoint\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/batch_id.txt`.\n*   To ensure data lineage, calculate the **SHA256 checksum** of the `normalized_data.json` file generated in Step 1.\n*   The file must contain *only* the hex digest string (64 characters), with no trailing newline or whitespace.\n\n### Step 3: High Spend Filtering\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/high_spend.json`.\n*   **Conversion**: Convert all costs to USD using the rates from `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`. If a currency is missing from the CSV, default to 1.0.\n*   **Thresholding**: We no longer use a fixed $1000 threshold. Calculate the **statistical median** of the *converted USD costs* for the entire dataset (after filtering blocked accounts). A record is \"High Spend\" if its USD cost is strictly **greater than** this median value.\n*   **Content**: The JSON array should contain the original objects plus two new fields:\n    *   `cost_in_usd`: The converted amount (float, rounded to 2 decimal places).\n    *   `batch_id`: The hash calculated in Step 2.\n*   **Format**: UTF-8, pretty-printed (2 spaces).\n\n### Step 4: Mainframe Export\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/summary.csv`.\n*   This file is ingested by the OMNI-7 mainframe.\n*   **Encoding Constraint**: The mainframe does not support UTF-8. This file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1**.\n*   **Header**: `ACCOUNT_ID,USD_COST,Original_Currency` (Case sensitive).\n*   **Rows**: Only the High Spend records, sorted by `USD_COST` descending.\n*   **Formatting**: `USD_COST` must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n**Validation**\nFinally, write `Validation successful` to `/home/user/cloud_costs/logs/validation.log` only if all steps complete without error.\n\n**Summary of traps to avoid:**\n*   Do not read the wrong rates file.\n*   Do not assume the raw input is UTF-8.\n*   Do not output UTF-8 for the CSV file.\n*   Do not use a hardcoded threshold; calculate the median.\n*   Ensure the `batch_id` in the JSON matches the checksum file exactly.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0a71c3ce-ec5c-487c-8e02-38a0a5e6c0eb:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Task: FinOps Q3 Data Migration & Mainframe Feed\n\n**Context**\nYou are a backend engineer tasked with fixing the broken cost reporting pipeline for Q3. The previous engineer left abruptly. We have a raw dump of weekly cloud costs, but the data pipeline needs to be reconstructed to support both our modern dashboard (JSON) and the legacy banking mainframe (CSV).\n\n**Input Data & Environment**\n*   **Raw Data**: Located at `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`. \n    *   *Warning*: This file comes from the legacy scrape tool. It is **NOT** UTF-8. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). You must handle this encoding correctly or the currency symbols will be corrupted.\n*   **Exchange Rates**: \n    *   There is a config file at `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/exchange_rates.json`. **IGNORE THIS FILE.** It contains Q1 rates and will cause financial discrepancies. \n    *   The authoritative rates are provided by the Finance team in a CSV file located at `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`.\n*   **Blocked Accounts**: `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/blocked_accounts.txt`. Accounts listed here must be excluded. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored.\n\n**Required Artefacts**\n\nYou must generate exactly four files in `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/`. The pipeline is strictly sequential.\n\n### Step 1: Normalization\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/normalized_data.json`.\n*   Read the raw ISO-8859-1 data and save it as standard **UTF-8** JSON.\n*   Ensure all monetary values are numbers, not strings.\n*   This file serves as the \"source of truth\" for the downstream steps.\n\n### Step 2: Audit Checkpoint\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/batch_id.txt`.\n*   To ensure data lineage, calculate the **SHA256 checksum** of the `normalized_data.json` file generated in Step 1.\n*   The file must contain *only* the hex digest string (64 characters), with no trailing newline or whitespace.\n\n### Step 3: High Spend Filtering\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/high_spend.json`.\n*   **Conversion**: Convert all costs to USD using the rates from `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`. If a currency is missing from the CSV, default to 1.0.\n*   **Thresholding**: We no longer use a fixed $1000 threshold. Calculate the **statistical median** of the *converted USD costs* for the entire dataset (after filtering blocked accounts). A record is \"High Spend\" if its USD cost is strictly **greater than** this median value.\n*   **Content**: The JSON array should contain the original objects plus two new fields:\n    *   `cost_in_usd`: The converted amount (float, rounded to 2 decimal places).\n    *   `batch_id`: The hash calculated in Step 2.\n*   **Format**: UTF-8, pretty-printed (2 spaces).\n\n### Step 4: Mainframe Export\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/summary.csv`.\n*   This file is ingested by the OMNI-7 mainframe.\n*   **Encoding Constraint**: The mainframe does not support UTF-8. This file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1**.\n*   **Header**: `ACCOUNT_ID,USD_COST,Original_Currency` (Case sensitive).\n*   **Rows**: Only the High Spend records, sorted by `USD_COST` descending.\n*   **Formatting**: `USD_COST` must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n**Validation**\nFinally, write `Validation successful` to `/home/user/cloud_costs/logs/validation.log` only if all steps complete without error.\n\n**Summary of traps to avoid:**\n*   Do not read the wrong rates file.\n*   Do not assume the raw input is UTF-8.\n*   Do not output UTF-8 for the CSV file.\n*   Do not use a hardcoded threshold; calculate the median.\n*   Ensure the `batch_id` in the JSON matches the checksum file exactly.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0a71c3ce-ec5c-487c-8e02-38a0a5e6c0eb:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Task: FinOps Q3 Data Migration & Mainframe Feed\n\n**Context**\nYou are a backend engineer tasked with fixing the broken cost reporting pipeline for Q3. The previous engineer left abruptly. We have a raw dump of weekly cloud costs, but the data pipeline needs to be reconstructed to support both our modern dashboard (JSON) and the legacy banking mainframe (CSV).\n\n**Input Data & Environment**\n*   **Raw Data**: Located at `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`. \n    *   *Warning*: This file comes from the legacy scrape tool. It is **NOT** UTF-8. It is encoded in **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1). You must handle this encoding correctly or the currency symbols will be corrupted.\n*   **Exchange Rates**: \n    *   There is a config file at `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/exchange_rates.json`. **IGNORE THIS FILE.** It contains Q1 rates and will cause financial discrepancies. \n    *   The authoritative rates are provided by the Finance team in a CSV file located at `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`.\n*   **Blocked Accounts**: `/home/user/cloud_costs/config/blocked_accounts.txt`. Accounts listed here must be excluded. Lines starting with `#` are comments and must be ignored.\n\n**Required Artefacts**\n\nYou must generate exactly four files in `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/`. The pipeline is strictly sequential.\n\n### Step 1: Normalization\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/normalized_data.json`.\n*   Read the raw ISO-8859-1 data and save it as standard **UTF-8** JSON.\n*   Ensure all monetary values are numbers, not strings.\n*   This file serves as the \"source of truth\" for the downstream steps.\n\n### Step 2: Audit Checkpoint\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/batch_id.txt`.\n*   To ensure data lineage, calculate the **SHA256 checksum** of the `normalized_data.json` file generated in Step 1.\n*   The file must contain *only* the hex digest string (64 characters), with no trailing newline or whitespace.\n\n### Step 3: High Spend Filtering\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/high_spend.json`.\n*   **Conversion**: Convert all costs to USD using the rates from `/var/opt/finance/2023_rates.csv`. If a currency is missing from the CSV, default to 1.0.\n*   **Thresholding**: We no longer use a fixed $1000 threshold. Calculate the **statistical median** of the *converted USD costs* for the entire dataset (after filtering blocked accounts). A record is \"High Spend\" if its USD cost is strictly **greater than** this median value.\n*   **Content**: The JSON array should contain the original objects plus two new fields:\n    *   `cost_in_usd`: The converted amount (float, rounded to 2 decimal places).\n    *   `batch_id`: The hash calculated in Step 2.\n*   **Format**: UTF-8, pretty-printed (2 spaces).\n\n### Step 4: Mainframe Export\nCreate `/home/user/cloud_costs/processed/summary.csv`.\n*   This file is ingested by the OMNI-7 mainframe.\n*   **Encoding Constraint**: The mainframe does not support UTF-8. This file **MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1**.\n*   **Header**: `ACCOUNT_ID,USD_COST,Original_Currency` (Case sensitive).\n*   **Rows**: Only the High Spend records, sorted by `USD_COST` descending.\n*   **Formatting**: `USD_COST` must be formatted to 2 decimal places.\n\n**Validation**\nFinally, write `Validation successful` to `/home/user/cloud_costs/logs/validation.log` only if all steps complete without error.\n\n**Summary of traps to avoid:**\n*   Do not read the wrong rates file.\n*   Do not assume the raw input is UTF-8.\n*   Do not output UTF-8 for the CSV file.\n*   Do not use a hardcoded threshold; calculate the median.\n*   Ensure the `batch_id` in the JSON matches the checksum file exactly.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@0a71c3ce-ec5c-487c-8e02-38a0a5e6c0eb:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
