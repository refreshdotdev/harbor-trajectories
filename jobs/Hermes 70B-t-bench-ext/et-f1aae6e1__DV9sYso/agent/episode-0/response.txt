Normalize the raw ISO-8859-1 data to UTF-8 JSON.\n2. Create a SHA256 batch ID from the normalized data.\n3. Filter high spend records using exchange rates and calculate statistical median.\n4. Generate a mainframe-ready CSV in ISO-8859-1 format.\n5. Write a validation success message to the log file.",
  "plan": "First, I'll navigate to the appropriate working directory. Then I'll read the raw ISO-8859-1 JSON data from `/home/user/cloud_costs/raw/weekly_costs_dump.json`, convert it to UTF-8 JSON with proper number formatting, and save it as `normalized_data.json`. After that, I'll calculate the SHA256 hash of this file to create the `batch_id.txt` file.",
