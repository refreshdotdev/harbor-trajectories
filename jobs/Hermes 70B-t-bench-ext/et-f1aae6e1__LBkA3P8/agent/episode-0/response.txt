  "analysis": "The current terminal session is active at `/home/user`. No prior commands related to the task have been executed, so all steps need to be performed from scratch. The primary challenge will be to handle the ISO-8859-1 encoding of the raw input file correctly and ensure all subsequent processing steps meet the specific formatting and content requirements.",
  "plan": "I will perform the task in sequential steps as required. First, I'll navigate to the project directory and create the necessary output directory structure. Then, I'll read the raw ISO-8859-1 data, normalize it to UTF-8 JSON, and calculate the SHA256 checksum for audit. Next, I'll load exchange rates from the correct CSV, filter out blocked accounts, convert costs to USD, calculate the statistical median, and generate the high spend JSON with the required fields. Finally, I'll create the ISO-8859-1 encoded CSV for the mainframe and write a validation log.",
