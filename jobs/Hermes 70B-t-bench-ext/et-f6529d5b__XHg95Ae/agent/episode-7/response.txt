The file count and total bytes are 0, which is expected since there were no valid files in the source directory. The log checksum and HMAC signature have been computed and included. The final step is to perform the integrity verification by reading back the log file and appending the verification status.",
  "plan": "We will now write a final script to: 1) Parse the `checksum_audit.log` file (remembering it is in ISO-8859-1). 2) For each file record, read the filename and its recorded SHA-256 hash. 3) Compute the actual SHA-256 hash of the corresponding file on disk. 4) Compare the computed hash with the recorded hash. 5) Append either `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED` to the log file in ISO-8859-1 encoding.",
