You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- You must end every command with a newline (\n) or it will not execute.
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:
You are a backend engineer tasked with generating a formal compliance audit for the 2023-Q4 release artifacts. The auditors use a legacy mainframe system to verify these logs, so adherence to specific binary formats and encoding standards is critical.

**The Source Material**
All artifacts are located in `/home/user/source_files/`. The directory contains a mixture of production files, documentation, temporary data, and symbolic links. 

**Filtering & Selection Logic**
We only audit "valid" release artifacts. A file is considered a valid artifact if it meets the following criteria:
1. It is a **text file** (ends in `.txt`), regardless of size.
2. OR, it is any other regular file larger than or equal to **1024 bytes** (1KB).
3. **Symbolic links** must be followed. If a symlink points to a valid artifact (based on the target's properties), treat the symlink itself as the artifact (record the symlink's name, but hash the target's contents). Ignore broken symlinks.
4. Explicitly **exclude** any hidden files (starting with `.`) and any subdirectories.

**Task A: The Audit Log**
Create a directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` (mode 0700). Inside, generate a log file named `checksum_audit.log`.

*   **Encoding**: The auditors' mainframe strictly requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for this file. This is crucial because some filenames may contain accented characters.
*   **Sorting**: The file records must be sorted by filename using standard **ASCII collation** (i.e., the `C` locale sorting order), not the default UTF-8 dictionary sort.
*   **Content Format**: The log must follow this strict template:

    ```text
    START       : 2023-Q4 checksum verification
    START_TIME  : <ISO-8601 timestamp>

    FILE_RECORDS
    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>
    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>
    ...

    END_TIME    : <ISO-8601 timestamp>
    END         : 2023-Q4 checksum verification
    ```

    *   Use exactly one space after the filename, and two spaces between the SHA256 and MD5 fields.
    *   The file must end with a newline.

**Task B: The JSON Summary**
Generate a summary file at `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json`. Unlike the log, this file must be **UTF-8** encoded. It should contain:

```json
{
  "period": "2023-Q4",
  "file_count": <integer>,
  "total_bytes": <integer sum of file sizes>,
  "start_time": "<timestamp from log>",
  "end_time": "<timestamp from log>",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "log_checksum": "<SHA-256 hex of the checksum_audit.log content>",
  "signature": "<HMAC-SHA256 hex signature>"
}
```

*   **`log_checksum`**: Compute the SHA-256 hash of the `checksum_audit.log` file exactly as it exists at this stage (before the verification line is appended).
*   **`signature`**: Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the `checksum_audit.log` content (same content as above). 
    *   **Key Derivation**: The secret key is the content of `/home/user/source_files/.secret` (strip all whitespace/newlines) **concatenated with the current UTC date** in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., if the secret is `abc` and date is Oct 27 2023, the key is `abc20231027`).

**Task C: Integrity Verification**
1.  After writing the JSON summary, perform a read-back verification of the `checksum_audit.log`.
2.  Parse the log (remember it is ISO-8859-1) and verify that every listed SHA-256 hash matches the actual file on disk.
3.  Append a final status line to `checksum_audit.log` (also in ISO-8859-1): either `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED`.

**Deliverables**
*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log` (ISO-8859-1)
*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json` (UTF-8)

Note: The grading system will verify the exact byte sequence of the log file to ensure correct encoding of special characters.
