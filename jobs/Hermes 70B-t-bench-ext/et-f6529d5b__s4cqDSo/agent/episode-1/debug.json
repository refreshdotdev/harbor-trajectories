The auditors use a legacy mainframe system to verify these logs, so adherence to specific binary formats and encoding standards is critical.\n\n**The Source Material**\nAll artifacts are located in `/home/user/source_files/`. The directory contains a mixture of production files, documentation, temporary data, and symbolic links. \n\n**Filtering & Selection Logic**\nWe only audit \"valid\" release artifacts. A file is considered a valid artifact if it meets the following criteria:\n1. It is a **text file** (ends in `.txt`), regardless of size.\n2. OR, it is any other regular file larger than or equal to **1024 bytes** (1KB).\n3. **Symbolic links** must be followed. If a symlink points to a valid artifact (based on the target's properties), treat the symlink itself as the artifact (record the symlink's name, but hash the target's contents). Ignore broken symlinks.\n4. Explicitly **exclude** any hidden files (starting with `.`) and any subdirectories.\n\n**Task A: The Audit Log**\nCreate a directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` (mode 0700). Inside, generate a log file named `checksum_audit.log`.\n\n*   **Encoding**: The auditors' mainframe strictly requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for this file. This is crucial because some filenames may contain accented characters.\n*   **Sorting**: The file records must be sorted by filename using standard **ASCII collation** (i.e., the `C` locale sorting order), not the default UTF-8 dictionary sort.\n*   **Content Format**: The log must follow this strict template:\n\n    ```text\n    START       : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    START_TIME  : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n\n    FILE_RECORDS\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    ...\n\n    END_TIME    : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n    END         : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    ```\n\n    *   Use exactly one space after the filename, and two spaces between the SHA256 and MD5 fields.\n    *   The file must end with a newline.\n\n**Task B: The JSON Summary**\nGenerate a summary file at `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json`. Unlike the log, this file must be **UTF-8** encoded. It should contain:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"period\": \"2023-Q4\",\n  \"file_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer sum of file sizes>,\n  \"start_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"end_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"log_checksum\": \"<SHA-256 hex of the checksum_audit.log content>\",\n  \"signature\": \"<HMAC-SHA256 hex signature>\"\n}\n```\n\n*   **`log_checksum`**: Compute the SHA-256 hash of the `checksum_audit.log` file exactly as it exists at this stage (before the verification line is appended).\n*   **`signature`**: Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the `checksum_audit.log` content (same content as above). \n    *   **Key Derivation**: The secret key is the content of `/home/user/source_files/.secret` (strip all whitespace/newlines) **concatenated with the current UTC date** in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., if the secret is `abc` and date is Oct 27 2023, the key is `abc20231027`).\n\n**Task C: Integrity Verification**\n1.  After writing the JSON summary, perform a read-back verification of the `checksum_audit.log`.\n2.  Parse the log (remember it is ISO-8859-1) and verify that every listed SHA-256 hash matches the actual file on disk.\n3.  Append a final status line to `checksum_audit.log` (also in ISO-8859-1): either `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED`.\n\n**Deliverables**\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log` (ISO-8859-1)\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json` (UTF-8)\n\nNote: The grading system will verify the exact byte sequence of the log file to ensure correct encoding of special characters.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@180318b7-a1e1-47af-a227-5b2860527d26:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\nYou are a backend engineer tasked with generating a formal compliance audit for the 2023-Q4 release artifacts. The auditors use a legacy mainframe system to verify these logs, so adherence to specific binary formats and encoding standards is critical.\n\n**The Source Material**\nAll artifacts are located in `/home/user/source_files/`. The directory contains a mixture of production files, documentation, temporary data, and symbolic links. \n\n**Filtering & Selection Logic**\nWe only audit \"valid\" release artifacts. A file is considered a valid artifact if it meets the following criteria:\n1. It is a **text file** (ends in `.txt`), regardless of size.\n2. OR, it is any other regular file larger than or equal to **1024 bytes** (1KB).\n3. **Symbolic links** must be followed. If a symlink points to a valid artifact (based on the target's properties), treat the symlink itself as the artifact (record the symlink's name, but hash the target's contents). Ignore broken symlinks.\n4. Explicitly **exclude** any hidden files (starting with `.`) and any subdirectories.\n\n**Task A: The Audit Log**\nCreate a directory `/home/user/audit_2023Q4` (mode 0700). Inside, generate a log file named `checksum_audit.log`.\n\n*   **Encoding**: The auditors' mainframe strictly requires **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)** encoding. Do not use UTF-8 for this file. This is crucial because some filenames may contain accented characters.\n*   **Sorting**: The file records must be sorted by filename using standard **ASCII collation** (i.e., the `C` locale sorting order), not the default UTF-8 dictionary sort.\n*   **Content Format**: The log must follow this strict template:\n\n    ```text\n    START       : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    START_TIME  : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n\n    FILE_RECORDS\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    <filename> SHA256=<hex>  MD5=<hex>\n    ...\n\n    END_TIME    : <ISO-8601 timestamp>\n    END         : 2023-Q4 checksum verification\n    ```\n\n    *   Use exactly one space after the filename, and two spaces between the SHA256 and MD5 fields.\n    *   The file must end with a newline.\n\n**Task B: The JSON Summary**\nGenerate a summary file at `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json`. Unlike the log, this file must be **UTF-8** encoded. It should contain:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"period\": \"2023-Q4\",\n  \"file_count\": <integer>,\n  \"total_bytes\": <integer sum of file sizes>,\n  \"start_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"end_time\": \"<timestamp from log>\",\n  \"status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n  \"log_checksum\": \"<SHA-256 hex of the checksum_audit.log content>\",\n  \"signature\": \"<HMAC-SHA256 hex signature>\"\n}\n```\n\n*   **`log_checksum`**: Compute the SHA-256 hash of the `checksum_audit.log` file exactly as it exists at this stage (before the verification line is appended).\n*   **`signature`**: Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the `checksum_audit.log` content (same content as above). \n    *   **Key Derivation**: The secret key is the content of `/home/user/source_files/.secret` (strip all whitespace/newlines) **concatenated with the current UTC date** in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., if the secret is `abc` and date is Oct 27 2023, the key is `abc20231027`).\n\n**Task C: Integrity Verification**\n1.  After writing the JSON summary, perform a read-back verification of the `checksum_audit.log`.\n2.  Parse the log (remember it is ISO-8859-1) and verify that every listed SHA-256 hash matches the actual file on disk.\n3.  Append a final status line to `checksum_audit.log` (also in ISO-8859-1): either `VERIFICATION_PASSED` or `VERIFICATION_FAILED`.\n\n**Deliverables**\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/checksum_audit.log` (ISO-8859-1)\n*   `/home/user/audit_2023Q4/summary.json` (UTF-8)\n\nNote: The grading system will verify the exact byte sequence of the log file to ensure correct encoding of special characters.\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@180318b7-a1e1-47af-a227-5b2860527d26:/home/user#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
