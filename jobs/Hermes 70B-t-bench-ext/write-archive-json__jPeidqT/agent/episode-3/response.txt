Great! The test files have been created. I can see there are also some additional files from a previous test session. Let me run the maintenance script now and then verify the results:

```json
{
  "analysis": "Test files have been successfully created, including the additional files from what appears to be a previous test session. The directory structure includes nested directories that should be cleaned up. I'm ready to run the maintenance script and then verify all the expected outcomes.",
  "plan": "I will execute the maintenance script, then immediately after verify the results by checking: deleted .bak files, moved .txt files, renamed corrupt files, manifest.csv content and formatting, summary.xml content and encoding, and the cleanup of empty directories.",
