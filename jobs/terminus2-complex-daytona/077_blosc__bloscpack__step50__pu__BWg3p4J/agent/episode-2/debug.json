On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration.

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\\n\\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"analysis\\\": \\\"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\\\",\\n  \\\"plan\\\": \\\"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"ls -la\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cd project\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"duration\\\": 0.1\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"task_complete\\\": true\\n}\\n\\nRequired fields:\\n- \\\"analysis\\\": Your analysis of the current situation\\n- \\\"plan\\\": Your plan for the next steps\\n- \\\"commands\\\": Array of command objects to execute\\n\\nOptional fields:\\n- \\\"task_complete\\\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\\n\\nCommand object structure:\\n- \\\"keystrokes\\\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\\n- \\\"duration\\\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\\n\\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \\\"keystrokes\\\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\\\n) or it will not execute.\\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\\n\\nThe \\\"duration\\\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\\n\\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"duration\\\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\\n\\nImportant notes:\\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\\n\\nTask Description:\\n# Task\\n\\nImplement the following function(s) to make the tests pass:\\n\\n**Target function(s):** put, __init__, __iter__, metadata, __init__, __iter__, __init__, __iter__, __iter__\\n**Target file(s):** bloscpack/memory_io.py\\n\\nThe function(s) currently contain stub implementations (`...` or `pass`).\\nReplace the stubs with working implementations that pass the test(s).\\n\\n**Test(s) to pass:**\\n- test/test_memory_io.py::test_pack_unpack_mem\\n\\n\\n## Repository\\n\\n- **Repo**: `Blosc/bloscpack`\\n\\n## Tests to Pass\\n\\nThe following test(s) must pass:\\n\\n\\n- `test/test_memory_io.py::test_pack_unpack_mem`\\n\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\n1.
