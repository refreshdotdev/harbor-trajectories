Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why?

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Task\n\nImplement the following function(s) to make the tests pass:\n\n**Target function(s):** assemble, integrate, __init__\n**Target file(s):** src/felupe/assembly/_axi.py\n\nThe function(s) currently contain stub implementations (`...` or `pass`).\nReplace the stubs with working implementations that pass the test(s).\n\n**Test(s) to pass:**\n- tests/test_form.py::test_axi\n\n\n## Repository\n\n- **Repo**: `adtzlr/felupe`\n\n## Tests to Pass\n\nThe following test(s) must pass:\n\n\n- `tests/test_form.py::test_axi`\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\n) or it will not execute.\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n# Task\n\nImplement the following function(s) to make the tests pass:\n\n**Target function(s):** assemble, integrate, __init__\n**Target file(s):** src/felupe/assembly/_axi.py\n\nThe function(s) currently contain stub implementations (`...` or `pass`).\nReplace the stubs with working implementations that pass the test(s).\n\n**Test(s) to pass:**\n- tests/test_form.py::test_axi\n\n\n## Repository\n\n- **Repo**: `adtzlr/felupe`\n\n## Tests to Pass\n\nThe following test(s) must pass:\n\n\n- `tests/test_form.py::test_axi`\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.

Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\\n- You must end every command with a newline (\\\\n) or it will not execute.\\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\\n\\nThe \\\"duration\\\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\\n\\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"duration\\\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\\n\\nImportant notes:\\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\\n\\nTask Description:\\n# Task\\n\\nImplement the following function(s) to make the tests pass:\\n\\n**Target function(s):** assemble, integrate, __init__\\n**Target file(s):** src/felupe/assembly/_axi.py\\n\\nThe function(s) currently contain stub implementations (`...` or `pass`).\\nReplace the stubs with working implementations that pass the test(s).\\n\\n**Test(s) to pass:**\\n- tests/test_form.py::test_axi\\n\\n\\n## Repository\\n\\n- **Repo**: `adtzlr/felupe`\\n\\n## Tests to Pass\\n\\nThe following test(s) must pass:\\n\\n\\n- `tests/test_form.py::test_axi`\\n\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\n1.
