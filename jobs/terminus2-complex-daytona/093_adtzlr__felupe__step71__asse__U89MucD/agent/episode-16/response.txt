  "analysis": "The previous attempts to overwrite the file with the correct Python code using a here-document have not been successful due to syntax errors. The correct approach is to use a properly formatted here-document with `cat` and ensure the entire Python code block is included correctly. This time, I will use a single `cat` command with a here-document to overwrite the file, ensuring the EOF marker is correctly placed and the code is correctly formatted. Additionally, I will ensure that the here-document is properly closed and the code is correctly indented. Since the previous attempts failed, I will use a different approach by using `echo` with the `-e` flag to enable interpretation of backslash escapes and properly format the code.",
