  "analysis": "The previous attempt to replace the stub implementations using `sed` resulted in the removal of the `GibbsExcessSolid` class. The correct approach is to manually edit the file to ensure the `GibbsExcessSolid` class is preserved and the `to_TP_zs` and `to` methods are correctly implemented. Since `nano` and `vi` are not available, we will use `cat` and `echo` to append the correct implementations to the file.",
