  "analysis": "The test has failed with an AttributeError indicating that 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'. This suggests that the `to_TP_zs` method in `GibbsExcessLiquid` is not returning an object with a `to` method, likely because it's returning `None`. The next step is to inspect the `to_TP_zs` method implementation in `thermo/phases/gibbs_excess.py` to ensure it returns the correct object.",
