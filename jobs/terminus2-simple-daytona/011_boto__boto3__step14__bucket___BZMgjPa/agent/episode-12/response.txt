**Explanation:**

- The previous attempts to correct the syntax of the `bucket_copy` function using `sed` have failed due to incorrect handling of line continuation characters.
- The correct approach is to use a here-document in `sed` to properly format the function without any line continuation issues.
- The correct implementation should not include any backslashes for line continuation and should be properly indented.
- The function should be implemented in a single line to avoid any syntax errors.
- After correcting the function, the `pytest` command is run again to verify the changes.

If the test passes after this correction, the task will be complete. If not, further debugging will be required.
