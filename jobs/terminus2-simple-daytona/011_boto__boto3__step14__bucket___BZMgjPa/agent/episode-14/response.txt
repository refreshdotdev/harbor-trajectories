**Explanation:**

- The previous attempts to correct the syntax of the `bucket_copy` function using `sed` have failed due to incorrect handling of line continuation characters.
- The correct approach is to use a here-document in `sed` to properly format the function without any line continuation issues.
- The correct implementation should not include any backslashes for line continuation and should be properly indented.
- The function should be implemented in a single line to avoid any syntax errors.
- The correct `sed` command should replace the entire function definition in one go without any backslashes.
- After correcting the function, the `pytest` command is run again to verify the changes.

If the test passes after this correction, the task will be complete. If not, further debugging will be required. However, based on the given information, this should resolve the syntax error and allow the test to run correctly.
