**Explanation:**

- The previous attempt to correct the syntax of the `bucket_copy` function using `sed` introduced a new SyntaxError due to an unterminated triple-quoted string literal.
- The correct approach is to ensure the entire function is properly formatted with correct indentation and no syntax errors.
- The correct implementation should not include any backslashes for line continuation and should be properly indented.
- The function should be implemented in a single line to avoid any syntax errors.
- The correct `sed` command should replace the entire function definition in one go without any backslashes and with correct indentation.
- After correcting the function, the `pytest` command is run again to verify the changes.

If the test passes after this correction, the task will be complete. If not, further debugging will be required. However, based on the given information, this should resolve the syntax error and allow the test to run correctly.
