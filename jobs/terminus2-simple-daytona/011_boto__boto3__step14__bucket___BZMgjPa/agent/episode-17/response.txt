**Explanation:**

- The previous attempts to correct the syntax of the `bucket_copy` function using `sed` have failed due to incorrect handling of line continuation characters and string literals.
- The correct approach is to use a here-document in `sed` to properly format the function without any line continuation issues and ensure the triple-quoted string literal is properly terminated.
- The correct implementation should not include any backslashes for line continuation and should be properly indented.
- The function should be implemented in a single line to avoid any syntax errors.
- The correct `sed` command should replace the entire function definition in one go without any backslashes and with correct indentation.
- After correcting the function, the `pytest` command is run again to verify the changes.

If the test passes after this correction, the task will be complete. If not, further debugging will be required. However, based on the given information, this should resolve the syntax error and allow the test to run correctly.

**Final Note:**

Given the repeated failures and the nature of the syntax error, it is possible that the `sed` command is not being correctly interpreted due to the environment or shell escaping issues. If the problem persists, manual editing of the file using a proper text editor (if available) or further debugging of the `sed` command syntax would be necessary. However, based on the constraints and the information provided, the above solution should be correct.
