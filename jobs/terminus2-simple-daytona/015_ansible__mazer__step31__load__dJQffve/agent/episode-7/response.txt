  "analysis": "The test `pytest tests/ansible_galaxy/test_install_info.py::test_load_string -v` failed because the `load` function returned `None` instead of an `InstallInfo` object. This indicates that there might be an issue with the YAML parsing or the instantiation of the `InstallInfo` object. We need to inspect the `load` function implementation again and ensure it correctly parses the YAML data and returns the `InstallInfo` object.",

Ensure that the YAML data is being parsed correctly and that the `InstallInfo` object is being instantiated properly. Specifically, check for any typos or logical errors in the `load` function. After correcting the implementation, rerun the test to verify the fix.",
