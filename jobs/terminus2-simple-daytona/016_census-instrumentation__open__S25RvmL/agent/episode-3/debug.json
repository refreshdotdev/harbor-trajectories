On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\\n\\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"duration\\\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer.
